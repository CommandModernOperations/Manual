Detection ranges are calculated based on the ESM antenna characteristics vs. the target radar's power output. High-end ESM/ELINT sets can detect powerful radars at extremely long ranges.</p> FAQ: What is the ECM model like? <p>Command models detailed jammer-vs-radar interactions including power output, frequencies, antenna characteristics, and sidelobe effects. Jamming effectiveness depends on the jammer pointing at the target radar antenna. Sidelobe jamming has less effect than mainlobe jamming.</p> FAQ: How does stealth work? <p>Stealth and low-observable aircraft/ships have smaller radar, visual, and IR signatures. Command uses several generations of radar stealth with various signature modifiers. A-D band radars are more effective against stealth than E-K band radars because longer wavelengths produce resonance effects with aircraft-sized components.</p> FAQ: How do Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) radars work? <p>LPI radars use very low power output (0.1W-1W) with better processing gain than conventional sets. They can often detect targets before being counter-detected. Advanced RWRs and ESM sets will detect LPI radars at longer ranges than basic equipment.</p> FAQ: How do High Off-Boresight (HOB) missiles work? <p>Both HOB weapons and Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMDs) contribute to firing arc:</p> <ul> <li>Standard missile: 40 degrees</li> <li>HOB missile: +20 degrees</li> <li>HMD: +30 degrees</li> </ul> <p>Example: Su-27 with AA-11 Archer (HOB + HMD) can engage targets up to 90 degrees off-boresight.</p> FAQ: Are anti-air missiles adjusted for range? <p>Yes. Rocket-powered weapons have PHs maximized at 50% of max range, gradually reduced to 50% of base-PH at full range. Ramjet-powered weapons (Sea Dart, SA-6, Meteor) maintain full base-PHs up to 75% of max range with only 25% max reduction.</p> FAQ: Does the aircraft bombsight affect accuracy? <p>Yes. Bombsight affects Circular Error Probability (CEP) for ballistic weapons:</p> <ul> <li>Basic: No reduction</li> <li>Ballistic Computing: 25% reduction</li> <li>Advanced Computing: 50% reduction</li> <li>Advanced Navigation (INS/GPS): 75% reduction</li> </ul> FAQ: How are periscopes simulated? <p>Periscopes are automatically raised when a submarine reaches periscope depth. They can be detected by radars that have periscope detection capability (not many do).</p> FAQ: What is a semi-active seeker? <p>Semi-active seekers home on radar or laser energy reflected from the target. An illuminator \"paints\" the target with energy that the weapon tracks. Illuminators require line-of-sight and are limited by horizon. Laser illuminators cannot see through fog or clouds, making LGBs useless in those conditions.</p> <p>Illuminator beams are displayed as broken red lines. Ground units can illuminate targets for aircraft LGBs if the aircraft lacks an onboard designator.</p> FAQ: What weapon guidance types are modeled? <p>Command models comprehensive guidance types:</p> <ul> <li>Semi-Active (SARH, SALH)</li> <li>Inertial + Semi-Active (INS + SARH/SALH)</li> <li>Datalink + Semi-Active (DL + SARH)</li> <li>Passive (ARM, IR)</li> <li>Inertial + Passive (INS + ARM/IR)</li> <li>Datalink + Passive (DL + ARM)</li> <li>Active (ARH)</li> <li>Inertial + Active (INS + ARH)</li> <li>Datalink + Active (DL + ARH)</li> <li>Command-Guided / Track-Via-Missile (TVM)</li> <li>Beam Riding</li> <li>Inertial (INS, INS + GPS)</li> <li>Semi-Active + Active (SARH + ARH)</li> <li>Timeshared Semi-Active + Active (TSARH + ARH)</li> </ul> FAQ: How does the visual/IR model work? <p>Command distinguishes between Detection, Classification, and Identification. Visual sensors have two magnification levels - low for search (typically 1-2x), high for classification (2-40x+).</p> <p>Detection ranges depend on physical size, visual/IR modifiers (High-Viz, Low-Viz Camo, etc.), and time-of-day. Contrails form at altitudes above 8000m when temperature is below -40C, making high-altitude aircraft visible at long range even when the aircraft itself cannot be seen.</p> FAQ: How does the F-14 TCS (TV Camera Set) work? <p>The TCS has 10x magnification for classification. When slaved to the radar, it can classify targets detected by radar at ranges up to 14nm (MiG-23) or 40nm (B-52). Without radar cueing, detection ranges are limited - searching with narrow FOV sensors is like \"looking through a straw.\"</p> FAQ: How does Look-Down/Shoot-Down (LD/SD) work? <ul> <li>No LD/SD: Can only detect targets at 5 degrees below</li> <li>Limited LD/SD: 15 degrees below</li> <li>Modern radars: No limitation</li> </ul> <p>An F-4E at 40,000ft can detect a MiG-23 at NOE out to 35nm because the angle is within the 15-degree limit of its AN/APQ-120 radar.</p> <p>Combat in Command involves several basic factors. First one must see the opponent. Then you must hit the opponent. The former involves sensors, the latter involves weapons.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#91-sensors","title":"9.1 Sensors","text":"<p>COMMAND has several different types of sensors that can be divided into four main categories: radar, ESM, sonar, and optical sensors. All sensors have a physical height associated with each of the components. You often see radars mounted on tall towers or on the tops of the masts of ships, this is done to improve the sensors visibility of the horizon. The mast height of a given unit can be explicitly set by the unit designer, or it will be estimated based on the overall size of the platform.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#911-radar","title":"9.1.1 Radar","text":"<p>Radar functions by sending radio waves at the target. COMMAND contains radars from the earliest and crudest sets to extremely advanced electronic arrays. As radars are active, they all have an inherent risk of being jammed and giving their whereabouts away. However, a more advanced radar will be less vulnerable to this, especially if faced against a less advanced jammer.</p> <p>Radars have a limited field of view they can search and track their targets within. Fire control radars in particular often have very small beamwidths of a few degrees that can only concentrate their emissions in a limited sector of the sky. Complicating this equation is how mechanically steered radar beams require a non-zero amount of time to orient themselves to a certain direction. Because of this, long range radars require several seconds to complete a circular sweep, and many early aircraft radars had very limited fields of view for search purposes. In COMMAND, this effect is modelled in several ways, and understanding the limitations often creates new tactical opportunities.</p> <p>Once a mechanically steered radar wishes to hold its beam on a certain target, it can no longer 'turn' to face another target. If the radar is an illumination type radar, it has to have a continuous line of sight on that target at the cost of not being able to engage other targets. In addition, all radars have vertical and horizontal limits based on the generation and type of radar. These limits provide unique options for avoiding the beam of the radar by simply staying out its effective field of view. This also means that approaching a SAM battery, for example, from multiple directions simultaneously prevents the SAM from reliably engaging in all directions. Note that depending on the generation of the radar, the ability to detect targets that are 'below' the radar and are close to ground clutter may be limited.</p> <p>Compare several American fighter radars:</p> <p>AN/APQ-120 (F-4): Basic mechanical scan radar. The earliest and least capable. With no \"track while scan\" function, it can either guide missiles to its painted target or search for contacts, but not both at the same time.</p> <p>AN/APG-63 (F-15A): Mechanical scanning, frequency agile. Frequency agile radars are less susceptible to jamming and \"doppler notching\", an air combat technique where an aircraft flies perpendicular to the emitter.</p> <p>AN/APG-70 (F-15C): Mechanical scanning, frequency agile, NCTR-JEM. In addition to move advanced electronics, an F-15C with this radar will have the ability to identify enemy aircraft flying head-on, as its NCTR radar \"counts\" the fan blades of their engines.</p> <p>AN/APG-77 (F-22): Active electronically scanned array, NCTR-NBILST. This incredibly advanced radar is electronically scanned, making gimmicks like doppler notching pointless. Its NBILST (Narrow Beam Interlocking Search and Track) NCTR function means it can positively identify aerial targets from any angle. Phased array radars also do not have the issues with scanning up and down that less sophisticated models do.</p> <p>Electronically scanned arrays have other benefits besides having enhanced detection capabilities. They are better able to filter out jamming thanks to their frequency agility and more importantly, they are more resistant to ground clutter once a target has been initially located. Ground clutter can still affect their search modes as in conventional radar, however in tracking modes, the electronic array radars are very precise, efficient and difficult to force a broken lock. One of the downsides of an electronically scanned array radar is that the strongest detection capability comes from the center of the radar projecting perpendicular to the face of the array. This means that forces wishing to be undetected can avoid being in the center lobe of the radar, and have enjoy a significantly reduced chance of detection when compared to conventional pulse-based radar.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#912-esm","title":"9.1.2 ESM","text":"<p>Electronic Support Measures are passive systems that can detect electronic emissions (radar, OECM jammers). They range from simple, crude radar warning receivers that can give a vague and imprecise (yet still very important) notification that an emitter is somewhere nearby to advanced detectors, that, based on the electronic sources, can conclude that the emitting platform is a MiG-29 Fulcrum A with a N-019EB radar. In COMMAND, aircraft will now start defensive maneuvering the moment that they detect illumination by a fire control radar, even before a missile is detected on route to the aircraft.</p> <p>ESM platforms, even more precise ones, have an inherent lack of precision compared with active sensors that constantly \"paint\" the target. However, having multiple ESM-equipped units present can counter that to a large extent by triangulating the signals.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#913-optical-sensors","title":"9.1.3 Optical Sensors","text":"<p>Almost every human has two optical sensors in the front of their head. In addition to the \"Mk 1 Eyeballs\", COMMAND boasts many types of electro-optical sensors, including cameras and infrared systems. These range from early, cumbersome TV cameras to incredibly sophisticated imaging infrared systems.</p> <p>The biggest advantage optical systems offer over radars is their passivity. Because optical systems are considered \"passive\" sensors and do not emit, they are not vulnerable to being picked up by ESM the way radars are. Imaging optical systems also can confirm the identity of a target in a way that most radars cannot.</p> <p>However, optical systems also have significant disadvantages. One is a \"looking through a straw\" effect where the camera has a very limited field of view. Another is a lack of precision, with electro-optical systems working by themselves can only gain precise target information at very short ranges.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#914-sonar","title":"9.1.4 Sonar","text":"<p>Active sonar is like underwater \"radar\" (an apt comparison, as both reflect waves of energy off the target). It creates a more precise contact at the expense of being easily detected. Passive sonar has many of the same weaknesses as electro-optical systems (imprecise, especially at long range) but also their strengths (passive, does not give away the sensor when being used). Vertical flank arrays are now used to create more precise target tracks against underwater targets.</p> <p>Towed arrays are used on many ships and submarines. They can be held a distance away, making them less vulnerable to their own engine noises, and they can sit below the thermal layer, reaching past it the way a hull sonar on a surface ship cannot.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#915-pcls","title":"9.1.5 PCLS","text":"<p>One newer type of electronic detection is the passive coherent location system (PCLS). This system uses the reflection of electronic waves against the body of an object but instead of utilizing a transmitter/receiver combination as in conventional radar, it uses existing electromagnetic noise created by everything from cell phone towers to VOR beacons. The PCLS monitors the propagation and properties of these existing signals with multiple receivers spread apart to determine the presence of an object without having an active signal of their own. In order for this process to work, there has to be an appropriate set of transmitters as well as a constellation of typically ground based receivers.</p> <p>In COMMAND, PCL systems are modelled by placing several sources of electromagnetic emission such as radio and tv towers and the setting up a PCL platform in a position where it can receive both the 'echoes' of the target as well as the source of the radiating signal. It typically takes three or more accurate sources and reflection to develop a strong enough track and while PCL can determine the vicinity of the target, a targeting quality track will require alternate detection systems to acquire that target.

Most ballistic missiles operate by having a large rocket power a payload into a tall parabolic arc. When the rocket burns out, the weapon continues to glide to its apogee before gravity and drag catch up and the weapon begins to glide back towards the ground. In some ballistic missiles, particularly ICBMs, the payload of the weapon detaches from the main body of the weapon and as such presents a much smaller and more difficult target to destroy. In addition to the payload containing a warhead, ballistic missiles may now be equipped with decoys or hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) to increase the probability of striking the target and not being intercepted.</p> <p>COMMAND models all phases of a ballistic missile trajectory in detail and the challenge in detecting and successfully intercepting these weapons. Although many countries throughout the world have developed dedicated systems to defeat these weapons, the incredibly high speeds and the enhanced maneuverability of recent systems has resulted in several countries seeking systems other than guided missiles, including sci-fi like lasers and high-velocity weapons. COMMAND models all phases of ABM carefully and dedicated systems for the purposes of shooting down ballistic missiles fire when the proper opportunity is detected.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#922-guided-weapons","title":"9.2.2 Guided Weapons","text":"<p>Guided weapons include guided missiles and so-called \"smart bombs\". The guidance systems present in COMMAND include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inertial guidance. The weapon is programmed to fire on a specific set   of coordinates and its internal systems direct it (to the best of   their ability) to those coordinates. Weapons with inertial guidance   range from early ballistic missiles that will be lucky to land in the   boundaries of their target city to advanced, ultra-precise weapons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optical guidance. The weapon homes in on an image of the target.   Optical systems range from early, crude ones like the GBU-8 HOBOS to   advanced imaging infrared systems (that can even act as makeshift   sensors in their own right).</p> </li> <li> <p>Infrared Guidance. The weapon homes in on the heat signature of the   target. In modern seekers with imaging systems this overlaps with   \"optical guidance\", but it applies also to early heat-seeking   missiles. Anti-air IR missiles come in three varieties:</p> </li> <li> <p>Stern chase (need to be right behind to get a good lock, i.e.     AIM-9b/AA-2),</p> </li> <li> <p>Rear Aspect (still need to be behind; yet are more flexible than     stern-chase weapons, IE, AIM-9H/AA-8)</p> </li> <li> <p>All Aspect (can fire on the target from any angle, i.e.     AIM-9L+/AA-11).</p> </li> <li> <p>Semi-Active Radar Guidance: In short, this guidance system involves   the missile homing on a target \"painted\" by a radar. Breaking the lock   (such as forcing the launcher to turn away) will cause it to lose   control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Semi-Active Laser Guidance: This is the classic laser guided bomb,   where the launcher paints the target with a laser designator and the   weapon homes in on the designator. Some types of weapons can use   \"buddy lasing\" (where an aircraft or even a ground unit can designate   the target while the other drops from farther away)</p> </li> <li> <p>Active Radar Homing: This involves an emitting radar system on the   weapon itself. ARH was pioneered on anti-ship missiles like the SS-N-2   that were big and only had to engage slow targets. Later it became   miniaturized enough to be used for AAW weapons like the AMRAAM.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It's important to note that ARH does not necessarily mean the weapon can just be fired \"blindly\". Most AMRAAM-style ARH air-to-air weapons (except for newer ones with an appropriate datalink and a friendly illuminator nearby, like an E-2D Advanced Hawkeye and AIM-120D advanced AMRAAM) need the launching platform to detect and illuminate the target with its own radar before launching.</p> <p>Guided missiles have an additional challenge to employment, and that is in how they propelled towards the target. While the popular view of missiles in movies depicts a slow-moving projectile powered continuously throughout flight, only cruise missiles have that type of capability. The majority of missiles use a boost-coast model for propulsion meaning that they burn their motors for a certain amount of time to build up speed and then glide towards the target using the energy they accumulated during their initial acceleration. Not only does this mean that a typical guided weapon operates at its peak speed for only a few moments before atmospheric drag and gravity takes over, slowing the weapon down. This tendency for a missile to exhaust itself in thicker air along with losing energy as it maneuvers is one of the defenses a modern pilot has against these formidable weapons.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that some guided weapons, particularly those optimized for very long-range engagements, employ not only a boost-glide model, but utilize a very high lofted trajectory whereby the guided weapon is shot to very high altitudes where atmospheric drag is less and then glides downwards onto the target constantly accelerating due to the force of gravity. Many of these types of guided weapons are 'smart' in that they will select the optimum trajectory depending on the interception time and range to the target.</p> <p>There are some guided weapons modelled in command such as the RIM-174 (SM-6) that use a continuous burning motor. These types of weapons are usually employed against ballistic missiles or very high-altitude targets and will also include maneuvering jets to improve interception accuracy in exoatmospheric engagements.</p> <p>COMMAND also models loiter-type weapons such as the ALARM anti-radiation missile. This weapon is designed in such a way that if it loses contact with an emitting target, it deploys a parachute and begins gliding downwards. When the target radar system is reacquired, the parachute is jettisoned and the rocket motor fires again providing the required thrust to complete the weapon's journey towards the target.</p> <p>Some guided weapons have multiple types of guidance built into them. This provides an additional layer of redundancy should one of the seekers or fail or the target is impossible to detect using it. An example of one of these weapons is the AIM-88E AARGM, a specialized radar-destroying missile that can use passive radar guidance to home into a radar but in the event that the radar is turned off, it can use a combination of GPS and active radar to guide towards the target.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#923-torpedoes","title":"9.2.3 Torpedoes","text":"<p>Torpedoes swim through the water.

It also depends on sensors and/or the capability of the weapon. So, at one extreme, there are early stern-chase infrared missiles that require the attacker to line up straight behind the target and early SARH missiles that render the attacker's radar unable to do anything else while it guides them. At the other are all-aspect, off-boresight missiles; able to be launched from incredible positions with a helmet mounted sight and CEC-datalinked active radar missiles able to be launched from far away and guided by another aircraft with the launcher never needing to turn on its position-exposing radar.</p> <p>The target may not see anything and only hope the aiming of the guns is poor or the missile prone to inaccuracy (This is historically accurate, as the overwhelming majority of losers in air combat never saw anything until it was too late). Should they notice, the target shifts to \"engaged defensive\" and attempts countermeasures. These countermeasures include dodging, countermeasures, and aggressive maneuvering.</p> <p>Dodging, trying to \"beam\" (fly perpendicular to) the weapon or radar. This results in a dice roll that gives it a penalty to hit. The penalty is highly dependent on the target's skill and aircraft agility. Even a master pilot can't do much in a lumbering cargo plane or heavy bomber, but in a nimble fighter, a novice can lose a dogfight to a plane of an earlier period. Dodging does not apply just to missiles. The enemy aircraft itself or the radar can trigger evasion, the latter to attempt \"doppler-notching\", a way of exploiting limitations of (particularly earlier) radars. Aircraft maneuvering in dogfights is affected by physics, which range from airframe limitations (aircraft have to roll into turns) to pilot limitations (as seen on the right-hand display under G-force).</p> <p>Deploying countermeasures, such as chaff and DECM against radar guided missiles or flares/IRCM against infrared ones. This is highly dependent on the technology level of both weapon and countermeasure and is treated as a separate calculation before the dodge phase.</p> <p>Example: A shah-vintage Iranian F-4 Phantom engages a modern, highly skilled American fighter over the Strait of Hormuz with ancient early AIM-7s. While a victory is still possible, it's a steep hill to climb. Even before the skill of the American pilot and the weaker kinematics of the Sparrow come into effect, the missile must overcome a chaff release and electronic jammer, both of which it is highly susceptible to. When the situation is reversed, the old electronics and chaff of a Phantom or even Tomcat offer far less in the way of protection against an AMRAAM. If the target survives or notices the attack before it hits and has an appropriate weapon, they may be able to maneuver and fire back. Then the situation repeats itself.</p> <p>Other aircraft are not the only danger that modern aircraft face, and thanks to improved missile and radar designs, surface-to-air missile batteries have evolved significantly and their efficiency and effectiveness against flying targets cannot be understated. These systems are able to able to launch missiles that routinely travel at several times the speed of sound with enough accuracy to strike ballistic missiles from hundreds of miles away.</p> <p>Once an aircraft is fired upon by a SAM, it has several options at its disposal in order to reduce the probability of being struck by the weapon. The first maneuver it to simply turn the aircraft around and run at maximum speed away from the weapon. Since most SAMs use a boost-glide method to get to their target, this means that although the weapon is moving quite fast compared to the aircraft a few moments after launch, atmospheric drag and maneuvering can significantly slow the missile down before it covers the distance to its target. This means that if the aircraft can build up enough speed, it can literally outrun the missile. Since missiles can only travel so slow due before stalling or their guidance systems can only run so long before their batteries die, the weapon can be rendered ineffective.</p> <p>If a SAM is fired at a close enough range where it has enough energy to still catch up, the other option a pilot has would be to try to defeat the weapon by putting something between itself and guiding radar. This strategy works if the terrain allows it, the aircraft has enough to get to the proper altitude and if the missile launched from SAM battery does not have on-board guidance that can hold onto the target.</p> <p>The final option, also simulated in COMMAND is attempting to kinematically defeat the missile through aggressive maneuvering close to the time of impact. It can be possible through beaming or a high-g maneuvers to create a condition where the missile does not have enough energy or guidance to match the sudden maneuver. This is often a last-ditch maneuver when other means of defeating the incoming missile is not possible. COMMAND simulates these techniques based on the range of the missile to the target aircraft and the available energy.</p> <p>When aircraft are used in formations, many different options control the behavior of the wingmen when responding to contacts. AI wingmen can be told to engage and investigate unknown targets and in order to keep them 'in line', COMMAND calculates all distances based on the formation LEAD as opposed to the entire group.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#932-naval-combat","title":"9.3.2 Naval Combat","text":"<p>With naval guns, accuracy is highly dependent on the type of fire control setting, the range to the target, and the stability of the gun platform. A combination of calm seas and a heavy ship does wonders for accuracy, while a light ship bouncing in rough waters is the opposite. They may both be firing naval guns that are very similar or even exactly the same, but a small patrol vessel with manual control alone in very wavy seas will not hit as well as a large cruiser or battleship in a calm ocean with intact, advanced fire control systems.</p> <p>With missiles, the target has more of a chance to defend itself. The first line of defence is to try and shoot the missile down. This is a task dependent on the quality of both the launcher and target. Some weapons systems may be unable to engage low-flying or fast enough missiles at all, while others will struggle and have a low probability of success. The second is to deploy countermeasures (chaff/flares and DECM), which work similarly to those on aircraft.</p> <p>The OODA clock of the target, affected by its technological sophistication and proficiency, also plays a gigantic role.

But they're also very different in two important areas.</p> <p>The first is that submarines are both stealthier than nearly all surface ships and have worse \"vision\". This largely applies even in extreme cases. Noisy first-generation nuclear submarines still have characteristics no surface ship can match, and modern ones with ultra-advanced sonar still can't see nearly as far as a networked surface combatant. The second is that, surrounded by crushing water, submarines are incredibly fragile. There's a reason why submarine crews ranked at the top of the proportionate casualty lists in the World Wars.</p> <p>Thus, it's important not to get detected if possible. Use of the thermal layer (see below) is important. So is the realization that a submarine can be inferred and moved against even if it cannot be detected. Both inbound torpedoes (\"torpedo datum\") and ships suddenly suffering an undetected torpedo hit (\"flaming datum\") will cause a submarine contact to be generated for the \"victim\" side. Likewise, a submarine-launched missile observed leaving the water will create a contact next to the spot where the launch was detected.</p> <p>Submarines come in diesel and nuclear varieties. Although most of the gap has been closed in present times, earlier nuclear submarines are incredibly noisy compared to their diesel counterparts. Furthermore, their reactors and pumps mean that they remain loud even when stationary or moving very slowly.</p> <p>However, what the nuclear submarines lack in stealth, they more than make up for in terms of speed. Not only can most of them move faster than comparable diesel submarines, but all of them can move consistently faster. Whereas as a submerged diesel running at full blast will burn through its batteries extremely quickly, a nuclear submarine can keep going and going like a certain battery mascot.</p> <p>Moving quickly is an effective strategy against submarines, especially diesels. However, not all HVUs in an area may be able to move fast enough to follow that strategy.</p> <p>Submarine sonars get a clear picture only with a \"direct-path\" contact, a fairly close area to the sound, roughly analogous to the visual horizon. In deep water, a submarine with a powerful sonar may have a series of green rings around it. These represent the convergence zones. Units entering the convergence zones can be detected by the sonar, although their uncertainty zone is far wider than it would be under a direct-path contact.</p> <p>In shallow water, convergence zone contacts are not possible. This is a known limitation of submarines in the littorals, and the other side of the effects that also make them deadly.</p> <p>Understanding Depth Bands and the Thermal Layer</p> <p>What follows is a brief summary of how the different depth ranges (reflected on the depth-presets on the unit throttle/altitude window) are modeled in COMMAND, and the tactical implications of each.</p> <p>Towed arrays and/or VDS systems are represented by the red tails on each platform.</p> <p>Periscope depth: This is the only depth at which subs can use their above-water sensors (periscope, ESM, radar etc.). A strong surface duct is usually present, which magnifies the transmission range of noise well beyond nominal (in fact, in calm seas a surface ship can use this duct to get early warning of threats that are visually/electronically stealthy but acoustically very noisy, such as small high-speed boats). Bad weather significantly degrades this duct's effect. All sub-launched missiles can be launched at this depth. Because of the small water pressure cavitation sets in even at relatively low throttle settings. This is the optimum depth for detection against surface ships (and counter-detection by hull sonars on surface ships, as well as \"shallow\"-set sonobuoys and dipping sonars).</p> <p>Shallow: Some (but not all) sub-launched missiles can be launched at this depth. The surface duct is still present but significantly weaker. This depth is suitable for keeping an eye (or ear, as it goes) on surface traffic and staying near (or at) missile-launch conditions while keeping out of the strong surface duct (reduce counter-detection by air/surface) and keeping close to the layer below for a quick dive if necessary (ditto).</p> <p>Just above layer: Completely out of the surface duct, this depth reduces interaction with air/surface matters even more, at the benefit of ASW. Indeed, this is the ideal hunting ground for ASW-oriented subs with towed arrays. This is because subs at this depth automatically trail their arrays below the layer; thus, they maximize their detection range against anything below while masking themselves with the layer (and retaining their above-layer search ability with their hull sonars). Cavitation speed is significantly higher here. No missiles can be used at this depth or below.</p> <p>In-layer: Like above, the towed array hangs below the layer, but the counter-detection reduction is not as great (sound has to go through a lot less to reach an enemy sensor). Also, the unpredictable mix-up of warm and cold water at this depth range significantly reduces detection ranges against other subs also in the layer (think Mutara Nebula from Star Trek II).</p> <p>Just under layer - the Deep Sound Channel: This is by far the most transmission-friendly depth band, greatly magnifying detection ranges. Surface ships and subs just above the layer both trail their VDS or towed arrays in this band. Sonobuoys and dipping sonars in \"deep\" setting also operate here. As a result, this is the worst place to be if you are hunted by modern ASW forces (or conversely, the best place to be if you want to attract attention). As a consolation, cavitation speed rises even higher. ASW-tasked subs without towed arrays often loiter in this band to maximize the range of their hull sonars. Surface and shallow sonars as well as \"shallow\"-set sonobuoys and dipping sonars have their ranges drastically cut against under-layer targets, and in some cases may not be able to get through at all.</p> <p>The Great Deep: The DSC still has some influence here but not as great. Cavitation sets in only if you go flat-out (modern subs do not cavitate at all here, even at flank). If the sea bottom is shallower than the sub's rated depth, the sub can \"fly nap of the earth\" or even go belly-up (sit on the bottom) and get the benefit of greatly reduced active sonar echo. This is generally the ideal depth for \"transit\" mode, when the emphasis is on moving from A to B rather than hunting, or for stationary ambush.</p> <p>Please note that the layer ceiling and bottom, as well as its \"thickness\" (and hence absorption rate) are not fixed, but vary according to latitude, local depth and local temperature (the estimated actual values are shown on the map cursor). Trying to manually keep a submarine at the edges of the layer as these values shift can be a very tedious job, hence the depth presets which automate this.</p> <p>Convergence Zones in Command:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CZ detections are possible only if the local depth provides at least   600ft/200m clearance under the target.</p> </li> <li> <p>CZ information (range estimates) is displayed on the map mouse cursor   right alongside the thermal layer info.</p> </li> <li> <p>CZ intervals range from 40nm in the poles to 20nm in the equator,   depending also on local temperature.</p> </li> <li> <p>An arbitrary number of CZs are supported, if the sound is powerful   enough and the receiver sensitive enough. Maximum direct-path range is   20k yards (\\~9.5nm).</p> </li> <li> <p>CZ area depth (i.e. ring thickness) is assumed to be 5nm, so the   actual detection range at each CZ interval may be plus/minus 2.5nm.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To verify if CZs can indeed form between the sensor and target, we check not only their respective local depths but also the depths at the nadirs of each CZ curve; so for example the sensor and the target may both have an abyss below them but if an underwater ridge high enough is between them it may well block the CZ path.</p> <p>Sonar operators are assumed to be proficient enough to discriminate between a direct-path contact and a CZ one (by examining both aural tones and the bearing rate); as a result, the generated AOU will either start from the sensor platform and extend to max direct-path range, or (in the case of a CZ detection) start from the innermost CZ interval and extend to max sensor range.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#934-mine-warfare","title":"9.3.4 Mine Warfare","text":"<p>Since World War II, naval mines have sunk or damaged more ships than any other weapon. Immense resources have been directed into both creating and neutralizing minefields. COMMAND thus includes an exhaustively modeled mine warfare system.</p> <p>There are two ways of laying mines in COMMAND. The first is the \"prefab\" way in the scenario editor. Create a box of reference points, make sure that they're selected, take note of the water's depth in the highlighted area, and then go to \"Minefields\" in the editor drop down menu. Select \"create minefield in designated area\" and a menu will appear containing a long list of naval mines in the current database. These range from named specific mines to a list of \"generic mines\" of various types. The important kinds are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Moored mines. The most stereotypical naval mines, these can be laid at   a fairly great depth thanks to their moorings keeping the warhead at a   dangerous level. However, the moorings also make them easier to spot   (and therefore neutralize).</p> </li> <li> <p>Bottom mines. These, true to their name, sit at the bottom of the sea.   They are lower profile than moored mines and thus hard to detect, but   because they depend on their blast wave reaching the surface, they   have to be laid in shallow waters only. Some bottom mines are   \"mobile\", deployed by \"swimming\" out of torpedo tubes at a standoff   distance before stopping.</p> </li> <li> <p>Floating/drifting mines. These stay on the surface and are thus the   most visible. Floaters are very difficult for aircraft to take down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rising mines. Arguably the most dangerous type of mine, rising mines   sit on the bottom and then release a payload when they detect their   target, which can be an unguided rocket or a homing torpedo like the   CAPTOR. Rising mines combine the stealth of bottom mines with the   deployment depth of moored mines, making them highly dangerous.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once the type of mine is selected, choose the number to be deployed (if in doubt, add more), and press \"ADD\". The editor will deploy as many mines as it can in an irregular pattern. Frequently there will be less than the stated number deployed even if the water is shallow enough.</p> <p>The second way is via a minelaying mission. See 7.2.5 Mining Mission on page 156. Use air or sea units with a mine loadout (for the latter, mine weapons records can be added to existing units if need be) and execute the mission.</p> <p>In both types of minelaying, the deployment will be uneven and seemingly erratic. This is deliberate to ensure that opponents can't accurately guess the minefield's location after detecting a few of them. Especially if it's a prefab layout, make sure the mine placement is satisfactory. If it isn't, then removing the minefields via the \"remove mines from designated area\" function may be necessary.</p> <p>Once the minefields are placed and units head towards them, calculations begin when the units get close enough. Its detonation/payload release distance will depend on the type of unit and sophistication of the mine. An under-the-keel blast is highly dangerous and will destroy most ships. A distant blast may not be much on its own, but several can still be cumulatively damaging.</p> <p>To counter mines requires ships and aircraft with the appropriate systems. Countering mines is conducted via mine counter missions (see 7.2.6 Mine-Clearing Mission on page 157).</p> <ul> <li> <p>The two types of mine countermeasures are sweeping and hunting.   Sweeping involves deliberately activating the mines via sweeping gear   (visible in the DB viewer and on the map when activated) so that they   will explode at a less lethal distance. Many types of mines are   unsweepable and have to be neutralized one at a time via the more   painstaking mine hunting (having a diver/ROV destroy the mines).</p> </li> <li> <p>Mine warfare vessels are expected to get banged up by the blasts as   part of the job. For sustained scenarios, having a 1 /3 Rule mission   and a port where minesweepers/hunters can be repaired is strongly   recommended. A mission without the 1/3 rule can be used for an   emergency surge, if need be, but this is a game of endurance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aircraft tend to be worse at detecting mines but better at destroying   them, and the reverse is true for ships (thus they complement each   other). While less vulnerable, low flying aircraft can still be   damaged/destroyed by detonating mines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unmanned vehicles are ideal for mine hunting due to less crew risk,   but they have some limitations, such as having no on deck to shoot   floating mines.</p> </li> <li> <p>For mine clearing missions, a narrow safe corridor is better than a   too-wide area that leaves too much room for mines to slip through.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"combat/#935-land-combat","title":"9.3.5 Land Combat","text":"<p>Land combat in Command is currently very basic and works similarly to naval combat in terms of accuracy with gunfire or missiles. Land units are intended more as targets for air and sea units than as formations capable of credibly fighting each other on their own.</p> <p>This should not discourage scenario writers, for land units can still be very important. They can still fire and move, and the role of target is an important one. The offensive capability of land units is not incompatible with a role as a target-after all, you might be tasked to destroy a group of \"target\" AFVs before they destroy your airbase or other high-value unit. (After all, as the saying goes, \"the most effective air superiority weapon is a tank sitting at the end of the enemy's runway\".)</p> <p>The terrain a land unit occupies (visible on the databox) has a massive effect on both its speed and its resistance. Swamps reduce movement dramatically. Forests slow movement down and provide a level of shielding from bomb/shell blast effects.

This means that reloading (and firing another one) is not possible until the situation is rectified.</p> <p>Here is a summary of the no-fire explanations, what they mean and what you can do as a player to overcome them:</p> <p>\u00b7 Weapon mount is not operational: The weapon mount (gun, missile launcher, torpedo tube etc.) holding the weapon in question is out of action (probably damaged or destroyed) and cannot fire.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Be patient until the mount is repaired (if not destroyed   outright). If possible, have the weapon unloaded from this mount so   that it can be transferred to another suitable one, if such exists.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Unit is not authorized to use nuclear weapons: The unit as attempting to fire a nuclear weapon but has no authorization to do so.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: If you can (you are usually not allowed to), set the unit's   \"Use nukes\" doctrine setting to \"Yes\".</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target speed [target speed in knots] is much higher than the weapon's maximum target speed ([weapon maximum target speed in knots]): This applies mostly to SAMs and ABMs. Most such weapons have a limit to how fast a target they can intercept, either because of kinematic limitations or because their seekers and guidance systems can cope with only so much weapon-to-target closing speed. For example, most versions of the Patriot SAM can intercept tactical ballistic missiles, and the latest PAC-3 versions can tackle medium-range ballistic missiles, but ICBMs are a no-no.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None really, unless the target somehow reduces speed. Use   another weapon if available.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target altitude ([target altitude in meters]) is higher than the weapon's ceiling ([weapon maximum target altitude in meters]): Quite simply, the target is flying too fast for the weapon to reach up and intercept it.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None, unless the target later descends. Use another weapon   if available (there's a reason why, once more advanced low-range air   defenses proliferated, attack aircraft began flying at high altitude.)</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target altitude ([target altitude in meters]) is lower than the weapon's minimum engagement altitude ([weapon minimum target altitude in meters]): Most SAMs have a minimum engagement altitude below which their guidance systems suffer disproportionally from ground clutter and other factors. If the target is below that altitude, then the weapon cannot engage.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Wait for the target to rise higher or use another weapon if   available (there's a reason why flying low during the period of early   SAMs with low ceilings was considered important).</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon is not BOL-capable: The unit is attempting a BOL (Bearing-only Launch) shot but the weapon does not support this.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Execute a direct (non-BOL) shot or use another weapon that   does have the ability.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon needs a precise target location: Related to BOL ability or lack thereof, this weapon needs a precise target location instead of an ambiguous estimate in order to have a reasonable chance of damaging the target. Guns usually fall into this category, as do other weapons like ASW rocket launchers.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Obtain a precise target location and use the weapon or use   another weapon that is more tolerant of target ambiguity.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon is not loaded on mount: The weapon is present on the unit but not loaded on any of its mounts (e.g. stored in one of the magazines).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Wait for weapon to be loaded on mount; if necessary, assign   reload priority to it.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon is not suitable for this target: The weapon is generally not suitable for this target type (e.g. torpedo against aircraft)</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None; use another weapon if available.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Altitude too high (Valid: [weapon minimum launch altitude] to [weapon maximum launch altitude]): Frequently happening with aircraft but can also apply to submarines. The unit is high above the weapon's launch envelope.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Dive until you are within launch parameters.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Altitude too low (Valid: [weapon minimum launch altitude] to [weapon maximum launch altitude]): Flip-side of above; the unit is too low/deep to use the weapon.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Rise up until you are within launch parameters. (Careful!   You usually go deep/low for a reason - to stay out of enemy   sensors/weapons. Coming up may mean attracting the wrong kind of   attention.)</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target is outside weapon boresight limits: This is usually a problem with forward-firing weapons on aircraft (guns, rockets etc.) but may also manifest with fixed-azimuth (non-turreted guns).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Maneuver the unit so that the target is within boresight   limits (typically dead ahead of the unit's front).</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target aspect ([target aspect in degrees]) is out of envelope for a stern-chase weapon: Most often a problem with early AAMs but also certain old torpedoes: The weapon is not very maneuver-friendly and needs to be fired almost directly behind the target.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Instead of the weapon, the unit will have to do the   maneuvering; position it as much directly behind the target as   possible.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target aspect ([target aspect in degrees]) is out of envelope for a rear-aspect weapon: Similar to the above, but with less tight constraints.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: As above; get behind the target (or off to the side) and   launch the weapon if possible.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon cannot engage this target for another [time value in sec] (OODA loop limitation): Each unit has a certain delay between first detection of a contact (or being given its data from elsewhere) and being able to target and engage it (the so called \"OODA loop\" -- yes, the one from John \"40-second\" Boyd). With surprise threats this delay can often be fatal.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Solution: None really, just hope that the countdown runs out before   the target becomes an imminent threat. If it is already an imminent   threat (e.g. incoming anti-ship missile) and it looks like it's   beating the clock, hope that the unit has automated point-defense   systems that can ignore the OODA countdown and engage it. If not...   brace for impact.</p> </li> <li> <p>(NOTE: As a scenario designer, this problem can be mitigated by   increasing the proficiency of the unit/side. Higher proficiency units   have a shorter OODA clock)</p> </li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 ASW torpedo must be dropped within 0.5nm of contact/aimpoint: ASW torpedoes must be dropped close to the estimated target submarine position in order to have a fair chance of catching up to it before running out of fuel.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Get closer to the sub's estimated position and drop.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target is out of weapon's range: Quite simply, the target is out of this weapon's maximum range.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Get closer (which may be easier said than done) or use a   longer-ranged weapon.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target is within weapon's minimum range: Flip-side of the above; the weapon has a non-trivial minimum firing range, and the target is within it.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Open the distance or use another weapon without the minimum   range limitation.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Horizontal range to target ([range to target in nm]) is greater than the weapon's downrange at this altitude ([weapon downrange in nm]): This most often happens with aircraft-launched ballistic weapons (guns, rockets, unguided bombs etc.). The higher the altitude of the carrier aircraft, the greater the distance at which it can literally toss the weapon towards the target. At higher altitude this distance shrinks dramatically.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Get closer or rise to higher altitude to increase toss   range. Both these options carry counter-detection/engagement risk so   choose carefully (or use another weapon with better standoff).</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target is within 5 nm and outside the weapon mount's engagement arc: This typically applies to ship turrets/launchers. Command currently ignores mount arc limits for engagements at distances over 5nm; the implicit assumption is that at such distance's captains micro-maneuver their ships to unmask their weapons as necessary, and often even perform \"over the shoulder\" shots with guided weapons.</p> <p>At distances below 5 nautical miles however, there is no time or space for maneuvers and shot-tricks; a ship engages a threat only with the weapons it can bring to bear down the threat's azimuth. This can make life difficult for large ships trying to engage smaller, more agile opponents or pop-up threats like sea-skimming anti-ship missiles.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Try to turn around so the weapon you want to use is   unmasked. If the target is a high-speed incoming threat (torpedo,   missile e.g.) you have very little available time so this may possibly   not work.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Cannot fire weapon through ice: You are attempting to engage a target through the ice pack (e.g. shoot at a submarine with an air-dropped weapon).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None. If possible, wait until the target moves from under   the ice before trying to engage again.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Cannot fire missile while under ice: You are attempting to fire a missile from a submerged submarine under the ice.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None. Move the submarine out of the ice if possible.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Cannot use torpedo on ice: You are attempting to drop a torpedo from an aircraft/helicopter to an under-ice submarine.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: None.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Gun has no local control and no available directors: The gun is designed to work with a fire-control sensor on the same unit which is currently out of action (for any number of reasons: Damaged/destroyed, jammed, cannot detect target etc.), and it (the gun) has no local/manual control as backup. It is essentially \"blind\". NOTE: This limitation appears only if you have enabled the \"Detailed gun fire control\" realism setting.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: If the FC director suitable for the gun is functioning but   unable to detect the target, do anything necessary to allow it to do   so (counter jamming, change heading to unmask director etc.).   Otherwise use another weapon if possible.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Weapon must detect target prior to firing: The weapon must \"lock on\" to the target on its own prior to launch and cannot be fired \"blindly\" with the expectation of post-launch lock. Most IR-guided AAMs fall in this category.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Position the firing unit in optimum position for the weapon   to detect the target (e.g. in a dogfight, try to get on the target's   tail as much as possible). The weapon will do the rest.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 No weapons director available to illuminate the target: The guided weapon (usually missile) needs a compatible FC director to provide illumination to the target in order to guide the weapon, and no such sensor can be found (in an operative state). Similar to gun-fire control limitations.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: If the FC director suitable for the gun is functioning but   unable to detect the target, do anything necessary to allow it to do   so (counter jamming, change position to obtain line-of-sight etc.).   Otherwise use another weapon.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 All illumination channels suitable for this weapon are in use: Related to the above; we found a suitable FC illuminator for the weapon, but all available illumination/guidance channels are in use (i.e. the system is already locked on to its maximum number of targets and can't engage any more).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: This indicates that one or more engagements are currently in   progress. Wait for the engagement(s) to conclude so that the   illumination/guidance channels can be freed up.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 All directors are unable to illuminate this target (insufficient reflection, no LOS etc.): The guided weapon (usually missile) needs a compatible FC director to provide illumination to the target in order to guide the weapon, and no such sensor can be found (in an operative state). Similar to gun-fire control limitations. This is frequently observed with guidance radars against low-observability targets (in fact, the F-117 was created to be resistant to guidance radars first and search radars second).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: If the FC director suitable for the gun is functioning but   unable to detect the target, do anything necessary to allow it to do   so (counter jamming, change position to obtain line-of-sight etc.).   Otherwise use another weapon or see if the target moves closer.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 No datalink channel available to guide this weapon: The weapon has a mandatory datalink (such as the guidance wire on a TOW anti-tank missile) and no channel is currently available.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: This indicates that one or more engagements are currently in   progress. Wait for the engagement(s) to conclude so that the datalink   channels can be freed up.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 Target is out of weapon's DLZ: The target is out of the weapon's dynamic launch zone (DLZ; see 9.3.9 DLZ and Why It Matters on page 214).</p> <ul> <li>Solution: Get closer to the target or wait for it to change its   heading/speed/alt so that it falls within the weapon's DLZ.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 The target's downrange ambiguity ([weapon downrange ambiguity in nm]) is larger than [some percentage] the weapon's acceptable limit ([weapon acceptable downrange ambiguity in nm]): This is directly related to the \"Shooting ambiguous targets\" doctrine setting. If the target's uncertainty area is such that its range ambiguity towards the firing unit is too large, the weapon will not fire. For example, if the target's distance has a +/- 10nm margin of error, and the weapon has an acceptable limit of 2nm (seeker limit, warhead damage area etc.) then the unit will refuse to fire.</p> <ul> <li>Solution: If you can (you may not be allowed to), set the firing   unit's \"Shooting ambiguous targets\" doctrine setting to \"Optimistic\"   or even \"Ignore\". This will make the unit all too happy to use the   weapon against the target even with a large margin of error. Beware   that this means a large probability that the weapon will miss   altogether. Ignore is not recommended against targets that have   visibly moved at all.</li> </ul> <p>\u00b7 The target's downrange ambiguity ([weapon downrange ambiguity in nm]) is larger than [some percentage] the weapon's acceptable limit ([weapon acceptable downrange ambiguity in nm]): As above, this time with regards to target cross-range instead of distance ambiguity.</p> <p>o Solution: If you can (you may not be allowed to), set the firing unit's \"Shooting ambiguous targets\" doctrine setting to \"Optimistic\" or even \"Ignore\". This will make the unit all too happy to use the weapon against the target even with a large margin of error. WARNING: Large angular margins of error mean that you have to be really lucky to get a successful hit.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#939-dlz-and-why-it-matters","title":"9.3.9 DLZ and Why It Matters","text":"<p>When firing a guided weapon against a target, we want to have a reasonable probability (if not certainty) that the weapon will reach the target. Against static or slow-moving targets this is a straightforward affair; against high speed and/or agile targets, however, things can get more complicated.</p> <p>One of the simplest concepts of estimating a weapon's reach against a moving target is the so-called \"No-Escape Zone\" or NEZ. This assumes that at the moment of weapon fire, the target turns tail and runs at its current known speed directly away from the launch point. The weapon then has to run the target down in a straight line.</p> <p>The simplicity of NEZ made it attractive for early missile fire-control computers and indeed it remains a widely-used yardstick when comparing the kinematic performance of weapons such as AAMs/SAMs, torpedoes etc. However, in real combat units rarely detect incoming weapons immediately at launch and not often turn tail and run away -- at least not if they have a job to do. The NEZ is also meaningless against targets that naturally don't run away, such as cruise missiles and UAVs (and non-alerted targets of any kind, e.g. very frequently ships under torpedo attack).</p> <p>Relying exclusively on NEZ is can also represent a \"hidden\" tactical liability. Consider an F-15 fighter preparing for a Sparrow AAM shot against a high-speed incoming MiG-25. Following NEZ's logic, the MiG's high speed means that the missile must be launched at very close range in order to successfully perform the hypothetical run-down that the NEZ is built upon. However, we instinctively understand that this logic is flawed: The F-15 pilot should instead launch the Sparrow at an even longer-than-nominal range, taking advantage of the MiG's high incoming speed and using it against it.</p> <p>So what we need is an engagement zone concept that takes into account additional parameters known about the target such as its current heading and altitude. This concept is the Dynamic Launch Zone or DLZ.</p> <p>Fundamentally, the conceptual difference between NEZ and DLZ is clear. NEZ answers the question: What will happen if I launch right now, and the target turns right away and runs? DLZ answers the question: What will happen if I launch right now, and the target keeps moving as-is?</p> <p>The DLZ is harder to calculate for two reasons.</p> <p>The first one is fairly obvious: Unless the target is coming head-on or running straight away, the engagement geometry is significantly more complex. The second reason is that in order to answer the question faithfully, the algorithm must consider the kinematic &amp; guidance idiosyncrasies of the weapon in question. Some weapons head straight for their target at a near-constant speed; others deliberately opt for a parabolic loft; yet others employ subtle guidance tricks tailored to the nature of both the weapon's role and the characteristics of the nominal target the weapon was designed for. All these nooks and crannies must be taken into account or else the DLZ calculation may well be off.</p> <p>Command employs several algorithms for faithful DLZ calculations, some tailored for aerodynamic targets (with special options for non-maneuvering targets such as cruise missiles) and others optimized for orbital &amp; ballistic targets such as ballistic missiles, re-entry vehicles and satellites. You will notice that AI crews are usually quite careful not to fire weapons at the extreme edge of their range envelope, preferring to sacrifice a slice of standoff for the sake of ensuring a kill. There still will be outliers though, taking their chances will long-range \"sniper\" shots that can still do damage.</p> <p>It should be emphasized that in the case of maneuverable targets, being inside the DLZ does not guarantee that the weapon will reach out to the target -- after all, an alerted enemy may (probably will) not cooperate. But even if a shot is dodged, it still puts the target on the defensive. The top Serbian MiG-29 pilot in the Kosovo conflict was finally shot down after successively avoiding 3 AMRAAM shots in a single engagement -- each time surrendering more of the initiative to his attackers, never having a chance to shoot back.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#9310-a-note-on-losses","title":"9.3.10 A Note on Losses","text":"<p>No unit is indestructible, and operational planning frequently matters far more than the exact quality of the unit. It is entirely possible for a MiG-21 to destroy an F-15 if it gets a clear shot.</p> <p>Much of the \"turning/burning\" parts of air combat are abstracted by hit rates and crew proficiency. The part of the human element the player can control is getting the assets to the right place at the right time. An example of the dichotomy between tactical weakness and operational strength is in the 1972 air campaign that beat back the Easter Offensive in the Vietnam War.</p> <p>In that, the kill/loss ratio of USAF aircraft reached new lows, with them having a negative rating even by their own admission during various points (meaning the true total was almost certainly even worse). Yet this mostly consisted of North Vietnamese MiGs nibbling away at the outer escorts-despite their weaknesses, they did their job of keeping the strikers safe. In Command, you can do the same.</p> <p>Even in scenarios intended to re-enact historical battles or wars, the results are frequently much different from the actual outcome. This is to be expected.

They can be added to scenarios either as a single unit or air base group. At the basic level they host aircraft, but they also support the simulations advanced aircraft logistics and sortie models and act as advanced targets. This section explains how to build these units and how to destroy them.</p> <p>Air bases are currently implemented in the game as either one very generic single-serving unit (Single-Unit Airfield) or as an airbase group that could include hundreds of individual facilities. As a designer you can choose the type you would like to use but unit-count does impact performance so it's best to use a single-unit airfield unless the air base has the potential to be a target. There is no difference in function between the two. COMMAND'S databases provide a ready selection of such bases in various sizes (going all the way up to multiple 4000-m runways) so you can select what most closely fits your needs.</p> <p>COMMAND'S air bases do model aircraft traffic, which helps support the simulation accurately model aircraft-sortie rates. When given a launch order, aircraft will start in their holding facilities such as tarmacs, hangars or revetments, move to a connecting/transit facility such as a Runway Access Point or Taxiway (or elevator in a ship) and then move to a Runway where they are launched. When they land, they step back through the flow to their holding facility, receive replacement fuel and ammunition and then start the process again. This helps generate realistic sortie rates which we feel are critical in modelling modern air warfare. It also makes airbases critically dependent on a few key nodes being operational -- or, put from another perspective, if an enemy damages or destroys certain facilities he can shut down an airbase with much less effort, just like in real life.</p> <p>Air bases currently support the aircraft logistics model in the game. All air bases include ammunition magazines which players can populate with the weapons, pods, tanks and equipment that aircraft need to successfully host their various loads. Fuel is not currently tracked but is provided automatically when an aircraft lands. As such, scenarios that exceed the flight time or an aircraft must include an air base or a ship capable of hosting aircraft or the aircraft will ditch (and be destroyed) when its fuel has been expended.</p> <p>For more information on how to populate ammo magazines please review section 5.3.1 of the manual. It is highly suggested that you use the \"Show only weapons compatible with aircraft hosted by parent\" filter in the Add Weapons dialog to assist with finding the correct weapon-records to add.</p> <p>Constructing an Air Base</p> <p>Constructing an air base group is accomplished in a similar manner to building other groups in the game. You should add the individual facilities and then group them by selecting them all and pressing the g key.</p> <p>It is highly suggested that you use our \"Custom Overlay\" feature to get a properly sized and sited image of the facility you are adding on your game map. This allows you to simply add the needed units where you see them in the image -- easily and with extreme accuracy.</p> <p>Once you have constructed the base, you can then use the import/export unit feature to save it for future use. We have already constructed thousands of airfields, airbases and airports which you can import into the game, so it is best to check first before spending too much time building your own.</p> <p>The databases have tons of air base facilities but the minimum units necessary for a functional air base group are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>1x Runway long enough to support the aircraft you will base there. You   can get this by comparing the runway length in the name and database   viewer entry with the aircraft Take-off/Landing distance field in the   database viewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>1x Access Point or Taxiway large enough to support the aircraft that   will be using them.</p> </li> <li> <p>1x Unit Capable of holding the aircraft (Tarmacs, Open Parking Spaces,   Hangars, Shelters, etc.) you'd like to host there. Units have the   aircraft size and capacity in their names which you can compare with   what is listed in the aircraft size field in the database viewer.</p> </li> <li> <p>1x Unit with an ammunition magazine (Ammo Shelters, Ammo Pads, Ammo   Bunker, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p>1x Fuel holding facility. We aren't requiring this as we are not   tracking fuel logistics but may do so in the future.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Adding Single-Unit Airfield airfields is straight forward in that you just add them as you would any other unit in the game. They include all the necessary pieces required to function and just require you to rename the unit to whatever you would like unit to be. These can be saved to import file and exported back in as well.</p> <p>Be aware that single-unit airfields are not intended to be targets and should only be included in a scenario where they will not be attacked. Thus, a forward airstrip in the heat of the battle should be modelled as a multi-unit airbase, while a base hosting long-range bombers far away from any of the opponent's weapons should be modelled as a single-unit one.</p> <p>Destroying or Inhibiting Air Base Operations</p> <p>Tying everything, we have learned about the functions of Command air bases and how to build them, we can now see ways to destroy or mission-kill them.</p> <p>Keep in mind that unless the air base is small enough and/or the attacker strong to simply smother it, determining where the individual aircraft are is essential. For aircraft parked in the open, this is as simple as moving a unit with optical sensors close enough to detect and/or identify them. Under the \"contact reports\" window, the detected aircraft will appear under the \"Spotted Hosted Units\" tab, they will appear on the message log when detected/identified, and on the map, a black triangle in a yellow box will mark any facility with hosted units inside.</p> <p>For enclosed shelters, things get trickier. The aircraft have to be spotted entering or leaving them over the course of air operations to get an identification. This necessitates either persistent surveillance (like a ground recon team) or good timing.</p> <p>Methods to Mission-kill or otherwise incapacitate a modern air base:</p> <ul> <li>Destroy aircraft holding facilities: Probably the least efficient   but you can eliminate all aircraft at the facility by destroying the   buildings/sites that contain them. Most nations harden these   facilities or disperse aircraft to make this task difficult. To   evaluate a weapon's effectiveness against a target please review the   weapon's legal target values and damage point value (DPs) in the   aircraft stores section of the database viewer and compare it to the   target's armor and damage point values.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Destroy Magazines: Destroying ammo storage facilities prevents   aircraft from receiving necessary ammunition. A combat aircraft   without its weapons is only marginally more useful than if it has been   destroyed. Similar to aircraft holding facilities, most nations harden   the facilities or disperse ammunition to minimize losses. Note that   this will not work if unlimited ammunition is enabled in scenario   settings, so if destroying airbase magazines is important, the   scenario designer should turn that option off.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable Access Points, Taxiways and Elevators: Disabling (these   facilities cannot be permanently destroyed and will eventually be   repaired given enough time) these \"transit\" points prevent aircraft   from reaching runways or other aircraft launch facilities. Usually   there are only a few of those in a base or ship so taking them out is   a great way to jam the base shut.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable runways: Disabling these eliminates the ability of an   aircraft to launch. This is often the most efficient method. Nations   tend to add secondary runways or use auxiliary runways to make this   task slightly more difficult. COMMAND supports numerous dedicated   anti-runway weapons. It should be noted that historically, runway   attacks have only been useful as \"temporary\" knockouts to airbases.   The runway can be repaired quickly just by repaving it, especially if   it's been hit by non-specialized munitions. As such, many planners   have aimed for targets other than runways to cause more lasting   damage.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note on airfield damage: Runways (and other air facilities) have what is called an \"effective runway/AC size\", which takes into consideration both the runway's nominal aircraft size capacity and its current integrity status, to determine the true AC size class that it can handle.</p> <p>Using an airfield with a 350 runway:</p> <p>* At between 75% and 100% integrity level (i.e. 0-25% damage), the runway can handle very large aircraft. * Between 50% and 75% integrity it can handle up to large aircraft. * Between 25% and 50% integrity it can handle up to medium aircraft. * Between 10% and 25% integrity it can handle up to small aircraft. * Between 1% and 10% integrity only STOVL aircraft or helicopters can operate.\u00a0(\\&lt;--- At this point you're literally looking at craters and broken chunks of concrete everywhere. Perhaps even the STOVL ability is optimistic, given that in such a condition the engine-FOD would be quite likely...)</p> <p>A sortie rate slowdown can be observed due to many reasons, e.g. some of the taxiways being knocked out (if the damage inflicted on the runway is part of a wider attack on the base). The taxiways and runway access points are a critical chokepoint and messing with them is a pretty cost-effective way of throwing the OPFOR's ATO/mission timetables completely out of the window.

They combine to become   more than the sum of their parts when properly cited, with the most   famous example being the North Vietnamese SAMs that did not score too   many kills on their own-because they made the Americans fly lower,   right into the teeth of the AAA that claimed the most victories.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Altitude/Short Range: This includes almost all anti-aircraft     guns and MANPADS like the Stinger and SA-7.</p> </li> <li> <p>Medium Altitude/Range: This includes medium-sized missiles like the     SA-6 and Aspide.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Altitude/Range: This includes heavy missiles, whether they be     early (SA-2 and Nike) or modern (Patriot and S-300 family)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Air defense facilities should cover as many altitudes and angles as possible. They should be mutually supporting, covering both the defended area and each other. Placing short range point defense systems around both longer-range launchers and search radars is recommended, particularly if the opponent has standoff weapons like Tomahawks. Radars should not emit unless absolutely necessary.</p> <p>For the destruction of air defenses, there are two options. The first is to simply treat them like any other target, engaging them with conventional strikes and patrols. The second is dedicated SEAD patrols, which focus on radar emissions. There is no one-size fits all solution to dealing with air defenses.</p>"},{"location":"combat/#95-unmanned-aerial-vehicles","title":"9.5 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","text":"<p>UAVs have become a dominant and omnipresent force on the battlefield.

Some UAVs, nothing more than remotely controlled aircraft, will on loss of signal become \"ghost planes,\" flying off on their last heading until eventually crashing. Some can self-recover, i.e. search for a new signal and return to base if reconnection proves impossible. Newer UAVs are proving increasingly more autonomous, able to complete their last orders, self-analyze their ability to continue, work together, or even \"think\" for themselves.

Each entry represents a specific configuration at a specific time.</p> FAQ: Why are later S-3 Viking variants not carrying ASW weapons? <p>The Viking's ASW role was removed in 1999. US aircraft carriers then deployed Vikings for the tanker role and ASuW armed with iron bombs, Harpoons and Mavericks. The ASW mission was taken over by Seahawks and Orions. The Viking was retired from frontline service in 2009.</p> FAQ: Why do many guns have such low Probability of Kill (PoK) against aerial targets? <p>Anti-ship cruise missiles are extremely difficult to shoot down. Even if destroyed in mid-air, a missile may still cause serious damage if the warhead detonates within 500m of the target, or if debris hits the ship. In the Falklands War, only one of six Exocet missiles fired at British ships was shot down - and this kill is not even 100% certain.</p> FAQ: Why do Aegis ships have empty Mk41 VLS cells? <p>There are not enough weapons to fill all VLS cells. Typical loadout for a Ticonderoga is 96x SM-2s (48 per VLS). Burke 'heavy' AAW loadout is 72x SM-2. Ships also carry a handful of Tomahawks and VLAs. You can reconfigure loadouts in the scenario editor.</p> FAQ: Why are some aircraft missing loadouts with weapons they could carry? <p>Just because an aircraft can physically carry a weapon doesn't mean pilots train with it operationally. For example, F-111Fs are authorized for Maverick missiles but crews prefer LGBs. A-10s are authorized for LGBs but prefer Mavericks, iron bombs, and cluster bombs. Command models operational loadouts, not theoretical ones.</p> FAQ: Why is there no 6-Phoenix loadout for the F-14 Tomcat? <p>The F-14 never trained operationally with 6 Phoenixes. Photos showing this loadout were taken during land-based qualification trials. The 50,000lb fully-loaded aircraft required dangerously low fuel for carrier landings. Even 4 Phoenixes was considered draggy. Command includes realistic operational loadouts instead.</p> <p>Exception: The 'F-14A Tomcat [Crazy Bob]' entry represents CVW-11's unique 1982-1986 period under Captain R.L. Leuschner, who ran highly realistic combat drills with 6-Phoenix loads.</p> FAQ: Why won't my fighters fly faster than Mach 1.6? <p>Warplanes never fly at theoretical maximum speeds operationally. Over a fighter's 6000-8000hr lifespan, less than 10% is spent supersonic. Going beyond Mach 1.6 offers no tactical advantage, uses enormous fuel, and may be impossible due to weapon drag, release envelope limitations, and the danger of high-speed ejection (survival drops dramatically above Mach 1.0).</p> <p>This is based on real-world data:</p> <ul> <li>F-16 minimum time intercept: Mach 1.6</li> <li>F-14A intercept speed: Mach 1.35</li> <li>F-14D intercept speed: Mach 1.5</li> <li>F-4 typical CAP max: Mach 1.35</li> </ul> FAQ: Why do torpedoes have such short range? <p>Soviet doctrine stated torpedoes should not be fired beyond 13k yards. Hitting probability drops dramatically beyond that range, and you alert the target to your presence. Command uses practical firing ranges (~8nm) based on real-world doctrine, not maximum theoretical range. You can still BOL-launch torpedoes for manual guidance at longer ranges.</p> FAQ: What are the New Threat Upgrade (NTU) ship advantages? <p>NTU allows ships to time-share illumination radars for multiple missile interceptions (similar to Aegis). Pre-NTU ships have pure-SARH missiles flying direct pursuit. Post-NTU ships have upgraded missiles, AEGIS-style weapon datalinks, lead pursuit, lofted profiles, and in-flight retargeting. The difference is dramatic against fast crossing targets like SS-N-12 Sandbox missiles.</p> FAQ: Does Command come with a database editor? <p>Only in the Professional Edition. CMO allows customizing platforms within scenarios by adding/removing mounts, magazines, sensors, and changing weapon quantities. This prevents database/scenario mismatches while allowing significant customization.</p> FAQ: Where can I submit platform requests or report database errors? <p>Submit requests and error reports at the CMO Database Requests GitHub. Include links to reliable sources for new platform data.</p> FAQ: Why does the Cold War Database end at 1979? <p>1979 was a watershed year (Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Iranian Revolution). The 1980s saw the Reagan-era military buildup. Each database covers roughly thirty years - about as long as a professional military career.

Unit information is displayed below. This display also lets you filter results by name, country, or status as a real unit vs a hypothetical one, in addition to scrolling between chosen units and being able to find units based on their known database ID by typing it in. Finally, the DB window can be duplicated to allow for the viewing of different entries at once.</p> <p>The filters can be combined. As an example, typing in \"F-14\" will result in all Tomcat variants in both American and Iranian service being shown. After \"F-14\" has been entered, selecting \"United States\" or \"Iran\" from the list shows only the ones from those specific countries. With \"United States\" selected, going to \"Show Hypothetical Platforms Only\" will narrow them down further to proposed upgrades like the AST-21 Super Tomcat that never actually saw service. With \"Iran\" selected, going to hypothetical only results in a blank display, as the country currently has no never-were F-14s in its database.</p> <p>To reset the country filter, select \"None\" at the very top of the country list. To reset the hypothetical filter, select \"show all platforms, both real-life and hypothetical\". To reset the name filter, simply delete the current name.</p> <p>The \"Weapons\" section in the database viewer is not sorted by country, although it is separated by real and hypothetical units. It contains information on the range, signature, guidance system, and performance of weapons. At the bottom of every page in the weapons section is a list of all the platforms that carry it. This can vary considerably depending on the type of weapon. For instance, the AIM-54C Phoenix is only carried by several variants of American F-14 Tomcats, and the Fakour-90 version of the missile is only carried by one single variant of the Iranian Tomcat. In contrast, the basic Mk82 500-pound bomb is carried by an almost countless number of aircraft from many countries and time periods.</p> <p>The \"Sensors\" section in the database viewer contains all current sensors in COMMAND and their default platforms. If the same sensor is carried by different types of units (i.e. both ships and aircraft), it will divide them into appropriate groups.</p> <p>This display is important in helping make good decisions about how units and weapons should be used against certain targets in the game. Take note of ranges, weapon/sensor characteristics and damage point values. Sensor technology levels will affect their performance and ability to counter electronic interference.</p> <p>Unit radar signatures can be altered by loadouts. Aircraft carrying external ordnance will have a greater radar signature, with stealth aircraft being dramatically affected. The database viewer displays the RCS of each loadout. Loadouts that are completely internal and thus do not affect RCS are highlighted in green.</p> <p></p> <p>Loadouts for an F-35. The external loadout is far more detectable than the internal ones.</p> <p>Clicking the \"Duplicate Window\" button will open up a second database viewer window. It will display the current unit by default but can be changed. This is useful for comparing the properties of different platforms.</p> <p>OODA Cycle: The OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) cycle of a unit determines how fast it can respond to changing situations, especially dangerous ones. It is determined by both mechanical factors (representing the sophistication of automation on the unit), and human ones (representing crew skill.)</p> <p>Thus, for targeting, even if a unit sees/detects the opposition, its OODA \"clock\" must tick down to zero from its stated beginning before it actually engages. An old, crude unit where everything is manually operated will have an OODA cycle far slower than a hyper-automated futuristic warship.</p> <p>Besides the crew quality, the Combat System (shown in the database viewer as well) determines the practical reaction speed of a naval unit. Combat systems range from Gen 1 (World War II combat information centers, where contacts are manually marked on a transparent sheet), to Gen 7 (science fiction super-processors).</p> <p>Agility: The agility of the aircraft determines its turning radius and ability to dodge attacks.</p> <ul> <li> <p>\\&lt;=1: Early jets or slow, support aircraft (E-3, A-50, C-5, C-130,   etc..).</p> </li> <li> <p>1.5-2.5: 1950s fighters, high-end bomber aircraft (B-1, Tu-160),   medium attack aircraft (Su-24, F-111, A-6)</p> </li> <li> <p>3-3.5: Third gen fighters.

One example is the F-14, whose agility increases from 4 in the basic F-14A model to 4.5 in the upgraded, better-engined F-14B and F-14D models. Note that all types of units modelled in COMMAND have various levels of this targeting quality dependent on the generation and type of system. For an illustration of this, see the differences between an S-60 battery and a ZSU-57-2 mobile AAA. While both systems have the same base weapon, their response times are significantly different due to the nature of the layout and systems of the weapon.</p> <p>Weapons and sensors have a unique arc where they can be pointed and utilized, this is represented by green circles on the right side where the individual sensors are displayed:</p> <p></p> <p>These arcs can also be turned on and off in the display options menu.</p>"},{"location":"drop-down-menus/#635-browse-scenario-platforms","title":"6.3.5 Browse Scenario Platforms","text":"<p>This dialog allows users to see all unit types used in the launched scenario.

The line of sight will appear as a colored area around the unit, making it useful for determining what the unit in question can see or detect. The tool can be applied to either a friendly or detected enemy unit, meaning it can be used to either plot offensive (\"hmm, this mountain is a nice radar blocker....\") or defensive (\"Since my ground-based radar stations can't see well over here, I should send my fighter patrols over to cover the gap\") strategies.</p> <p></p> <p>The line-of-sight tool in action, with lime green selected as the color. To the north is mostly barren desert where the tool can reach its max distance. To the south is a mountain range where it's frequently blocked off.</p> <p>There are several customizable options on the tool.</p> <p>-Max distance. This sets the maximum range in nm the tool will extend to. It can be reined in either for the sake of performance or for showing a sensor with very limited range.</p> <p>-Target altitude (m AGL). This shows the altitude at which the LOS target is determined. Higher flying units can obviously be seen from farther away, and the setting can be changed in light of the usual attack profile of the scenario's threat units (i.e. threat aircraft with terrain following suites like F-111s or Su-24s will go at lower altitudes than ones that don't have them, like earlier and/or simpler aircraft). The \"same as observer\" box can be checked to assume that the target is at the same altitude as the selected unit.</p> <p>-Horizon type. The \"Radar/ESM\" option, assuming an \"electronic horizon\" capable of reaching longer distances than visual sight, is the default. The shorter range \"Visual/EO/Laser\" option can be checked, if need be, such as for a unit that uses those as its primary sighting system.</p> <p>-Shade color. Clicking \"change\" opens up a palette of colors that can be selected as the one to display. Color can be changed to avoid conflicting with other map elements or for the sake of aesthetics/ease of sight.</p> <p>-CPU Threads. This allows the number of CPU threads used in calculating LOS to be changed for performance reasons. (considered obsolete)</p> <p>It is important to note that line of sight is different depending on the type of system selected. Many radar waves have the ability to travel 'over' the horizon to a limited extent resulting in a greater range beyond that of visual and IR sensors.</p> <p>Minimaps</p> <p>This toggles minimaps. There are three main types of minimap, all of which can be used at the same time.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Global. This displays a map of the entire world. Only recommended   for very large scenarios, as the unit contacts will otherwise appear   to be incredibly close together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scenario. This displays a map with borders established by the   outermost units in the scenario. In other words, it displays a map of   the theater of operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Camera-following. Self-explanatory, this minimap zooms in and out   with the camera, showing what the display currently shows.</p> </li> </ul> <p>On the minimap, units follow the same color code as on the main display- blue for friendly, green for neutral, orange for unfriendly, red for hostile, yellow for unknown. Minimaps appear in their own windows and can be adjusted to be as large or small as the player desires. The minimaps also preview the local terrain making it easier to identify the orientation and position of various units as it relates to the world. Minimaps can be adjusted for size by clicking and holding the bottom right corner of the map.</p> <p></p> <p>Terrain Type Legend</p> <p>This toggles a legend that illustrates the types of terrain shown on the map when the \"Land Cover\" option is selected (see 6.2 View on page 113, and 3.1.1 The Globe Display on page 12).

scenario.\u00a0 After pressing load selected, we are given a much more detailed briefing.</p> <p>!</p> <p>The key things a player will be interested in will be the nature of the mission as well as the ways that it should be carried out.\u00a0 There are a few things that are relevant to us right away:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The objective is to destroy PLO buildings in Tunisia</p> </li> <li> <p>The enemy resistance is expected to be light</p> </li> <li> <p>We are to use the laser guided bombs to do maximum damage to the     targets and then follow up with Mark 82s after the targets have     received their initial damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ranges of the mission will be long, requiring us to conduct     refueling possibly in both directions.</p> </li> </ol> <p>On the next page we get an idea of the different scenario options that will affect us tactically.</p> <p></p> <p>We can see right away that the only real concern we have is aircraft damage which means if our aircraft are hit lightly, they can still safely return to base.\u00a0 Many of the other options are not present in this scenario because they are either not required or are not relevant.</p> <p>After we click Begin Scenario, we should pause and collect some intelligence.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We can see that our scenario bounds range from Israel all the way to Tunisia and that there are no exclusion zones or no navigation zones anywhere on the map.\u00a0 This means we have free reign where we would like to operate our units throughout the scenario.\u00a0 Keep in mind that these requirements may be spelled out in more detail in a briefing or may be implemented in other ways.</p> <p>We now would like to see what kinds of units are present in our scenario to see how this may affect our strategy.\u00a0 We will click Game -&gt; Browse Scenario Platforms and take a look at what we have at our disposal and what we can expect throughout the rest of the scenario.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Looks like we have some F-15Ds, a few rescue helicopters and a Patrol ship.</p> <p>!</p> <p>The PLO have a handful of buildings, and we can also see that Tunisia has a few F-5As that may give us some trouble.\u00a0 Let's double click on one of them and see what we can find out.</p> <p>!</p> <p>It looks like they can carry up to 4 AIM-9N Sidewinders and have a 110-minute CAP time.\u00a0 Depending on how many of the aircraft they have on the ground, they may be able to put up a continuous combat air patrol over the target region if they have enough warning.\u00a0 Luckily there are no EW radars in the scenario so it will be to our advantage not to use our own radars in the event they do scramble.</p> <p>The AIM-9N is an interesting weapon as well:\u00a0</p> <p>!</p> <p>The key element is that it is a rear aspect only missile meaning it can be used in a chase but not in a head-to-head engagement.\u00a0 This will have a profound strategic impact in our WRA later on in the game.</p> <p>There are a few other things we can determine from our scenario, and that is that we have aerial refueling aircraft in position and we already have patrol craft ready in the event we need to do pilot recoveries.</p> <p>The last thing we should check is the weather, which we can do by looking at the side of our cursor at any time.\u00a0 We can see that the skies are clear, the temperature is 21C and the wind/sea state is 3.\u00a0 This is good since it means we'll have excellent visibility all the way to the target and not have to fly below a cloud layer to employ our weapons.</p> <p>Now let's get an idea of what our strikers look like.\u00a0 Click on Tel Nof Air Base and press F6 or click the Aircraft Operations button at the top of the screen.</p> <p>!</p> <p>There is a lot of information here, namely that we are using the GBU-15, a very powerful bomb with the ability to glide significant distances as well as use a laser to hit a target.\u00a0 We also can see that we have a 900 nm strike radius without needing to refuel.\u00a0 We can quickly measure the distance on the world map by pressing Control-D and then clicking on the map and dragging a line.</p> <p>Doing so we can see that the range is a staggering 1300nm!\u00a0 This means that we will have to either refuel on the way over or refuel on the way back.\u00a0 Ideally, we will do both if we have enough fuel in the tankers to do so as it gives us the most operational flexibility.</p> <p>Un pause and pause the scenario.\u00a0 You will notice that a series of new contacts appear on the screen near Tunis.</p> <p></p> <p>We are interested in the ones on the southeast edge of the bay.\u00a0 Press the number 9 on your numpad to switch to individual view if the group view is preventing you from seeing the individual targets.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Looks like a pretty spread-out group.\u00a0 If we select any of them, we can see that their database entry says they are variations of Large and Medium buildings.\u00a0 Each of these has some light armor protection and a total damage points of about 450 for the large and 300 for the medium.\u00a0 That's important to know since it tells us about how many GBU-15s we're going to need to ensure target destruction.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Checking on the database entry for the weapon shows that each of these weapons will be quite capable of a kill, but we only have 6 of them at our disposal since each F-15D can only carry a single one of these weapons.\u00a0 In longer scenarios we could go back and rearm, but in this case we will be cutting it a bit close on scenario time if we try that, so we'll prioritize the larger buildings and let our sweep aircraft mop up anything that might still be standing with some careful application of Mk82s from the backup aircraft.</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1022-executing-our-mission","title":"10.2.2 Executing our Mission","text":"<p>For this scenario, we could potentially fly the entire mission manually, and this could work given how simple our scenario is, but for the purposes of this guide, we will use a strike mission to do so.</p> <p>Start by bringing up the mission editor by pressing F11 on the keyboard or pressing Mission Editor on the toolbar.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We can see that we already have a refueling flight in position and that there are a few extra tankers available to keep the track operational without worrying about having to chase a tanker back to base with an empty fuel tank.</p> <p>Select the PLO targets in Tunisia with your left mouse button and then click Add next to Missions.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We will make a few changes here and give it a name.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We will be using two missions for this operation, one will be the primary strike and the other will be the sweepers to do BDA and clean up any remaining targets.\u00a0 While it is possible to put the entire group into one mission, this will give us interesting flight size issues later.</p> <p>Press OK and head to the next page.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Before we add any units to the mission, we'll need to set up a few things in Mission Settings first:</p> <p>!</p> <p>We are shrinking the flight size to 3 since we have 6 strikers available to us.\u00a0 We are also setting the attack method to a stacked independent attack with a tight split to make the attack happen all at once, reducing the time our opponent will have to scramble their forces.\u00a0 Now click on Configure next to refueling.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We will define it so that we're using tankers from the AAR Track mission, to look for fuel at 35 percent of fuel and to NOT allow enroute refueling.\u00a0 If we opt for this, our tankers will run dry on their way back to the refueling track leaving us in a tough spot logistically.</p> <p>Now return to the units page and add the 6 F-15Ds with the LGBs on board.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Looks good.\u00a0 Head to the targets tab and set Opportunity Scrambling to \"Focus on strike targets\", set engage to shotgun to 'Engage until winchester' and then set Target Destroyed to \"RTB\".</p> <p>These options ensure we won't get distracted along the way with a tasty target.\u00a0 Finally, click EMCON/WRA.\u00a0 The general WRA is good for this mission as we have a pretty simple package that we are using.\u00a0 We do have a weapon release concern, however.\u00a0 If we open up \"Weapon Release Authorization\" we will notice that the default number of GBU-15 weapons to use against a land structure is either 2 or the amount the missile defense value of that target.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Unfortunately, if you check the missile defense value of a large building:</p> <p>!</p> <p>You'll see that our default WRA will use two of our expensive guided weapons per target!\u00a0 This is not needed or ideal for this scenario, so we'll change the WRA so that it only uses one weapon per target.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Looks good.\u00a0 Lastly, we'll visit the targeting priority page and prioritize the large buildings over the medium buildings.\u00a0 To do so, we'll simply create a few quick rules:</p> <p>!</p> <p>There we go.\u00a0 Now we are going to hit the biggest targets first with the actual amount of ordnance we need to accomplish this mission.\u00a0 Keep in mind we may deal with duds or return fire, but for this scenario, we might as well be efficient.</p> <p>Return back to mission settings and set a takeoff time of 5 minutes from now.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We'll do this since we need to coordinate with our sweepers and have them come out a few minutes later.\u00a0 At this stage we could create detailed flight plans including a refueling stop along the way, but for simplicity, we'll manually order up the refueling for the outbound leg.</p> <p>Now that we're done with that mission, we can set up our sweepers.\u00a0 There are a few different approaches to this that can include doing it manually, creating a patrol mission or simply adding another strike mission.</p> <p>We will:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Clone previous strike mission</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the two remaining F-15D's with MK82 bombs to the newly created     mission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change the flight size in mission settings to 2</p> </li> <li> <p>Change the WRA so that Mk82s will drop a full stick but from only     one shooter</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the takeoff time to 2 minutes after the previous mission</p> </li> </ol> <p>You might think that we should assign a single Mk82 per target, but remember these weapons are unguided and our aircraft will be in the danger zone of low altitude in order to employ them, so we want to limit their exposure as much as possible.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We are ready to go!\u00a0 Now we can un pause and fast forward to about 5:05 and watch our strikers take to the air on the way to their assigned mission.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We'll fast forward time for a little bit until our strikers get close to the refueling track.\u00a0 Then right click on each of them and hit \"Refuel if possible\" Then \"Select tankers automatically\".</p> <p>!</p> <p>All gassed up and ready to go.\u00a0 We have an interesting problem to consider at this point.\u00a0 Since our tankers will only have enough fuel for 3 hours at this point and our strikers have several hours of flight time ahead of them, we are in a position where our tankers might have to RTB before our F-15s get back to refuel for them.\u00a0 What we will have to do is manually order our tankers to RTB after all our strikers have fueled up so that a fresh set of tankers are right on station as the F-15s head home.\u00a0 They may have enough fuel to do it without the refueling, but we should be considering this possibility.\u00a0 Now we get to the fun part.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Turning on our radars seems tempting here, but if we do so we could cue anyone around that we're coming.\u00a0 If there was a more robust EW environment in this scenario, we would more or less have to or at least come in low over the mountains.</p> <p>!</p> <p>LGBs away!</p> <p>At this point our strikers turn back, refuel as needed and return to base.\u00a0 Once every aircraft has landed, the option to end the scenario will pop up and we can take a look at our performance.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1023-debrief","title":"10.2.3 Debrief","text":"<p>As we can see, while the mission was relatively

short ASuW operation where we will be utilizing three surface vessels and their gun armament to protect ourselves from waves of irregular forces in the form of PT boats and armed civilian junks.\u00a0 Although there are no missiles in this scenario, much of the surface strategy involved is applicable in the later ages and generations of naval vessel technology.</p> <p>After starting the scenario, we are presented with the Situation as well as our objectives.</p> <p>!</p> <p>There are several key points:</p> <ol> <li> <p>We are dealing with a non-symmetrical force meaning we will not be     doing a rolling gun battle with other vessels of the same     capabilities</p> </li> <li> <p>Our forces are mixed and older, but still very capable designs</p> </li> <li> <p>Our orders are to conduct a sensor sweep of the area as well as sink     as many enemy vessels that are either torpedo boats or junks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Our previous mission was to shell shore batteries, but that is not     required for this scenario</p> </li> </ol> <p>Upon entering the scenario, we can see the base layout of our forces:</p> <p>!</p> <p>The AA cruiser is to the south and the light cruiser and frigate are to the north.\u00a0 The two formations are roughly 26 nm apart meaning at flank speed, the best our solo ship can hope is to meet up with the main formation in about 49 minutes, which is a very long time if you are dealing with light craft.\u00a0 The northern vessels are about 4 nm apart making mutual support a little tricky, at least initially.</p> <p>Looking at the scenario platforms we can find out a few different and useful things, namely the enemy will have TK P-4s and light junks.\u00a0 The P-4s are the real threat as they pack the 43-36N torpedo with a maximum range of 3 nm.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Fortunately, the torpedoes are straight runners meaning that we could thread a torpedo spread if we are made aware of it.\u00a0 Other information we can determine is that the torpedo boats have a top speed of 50 knots and that they have a Skin Head [Zarnitsa] radar making it easier to identify them from their emissions if we need to establish who to prioritize.</p> <p>The Junks have a top speed of 18 knots and have some very basic armament consisting of RPGs and 12.7mm machine guns.\u00a0 They would only be a threat to us if they were allowed to get within shouting distance, so we know who to prioritize when the shooting starts.</p> <p>Our forces are a little different.\u00a0 The C 44 Jamaica is a light cruiser from World War 2, and it is packing 4\" and 6\" guns with a maximum range of about 12 nautical miles, giving us quite a stick if we need to pick off the torpedo boats before they can close.\u00a0 The Jamaica has a flank throttle of 31 knots and importantly, we know the orientation of the gun batteries from \"Arcs\" display in the database as seen to the right.\u00a0 If we want to have maximum effectiveness, we'll need to either face the target directly, or we'll need to be firing off the port or starboard side.\u00a0 This also means that in a chase situation, we are at a major disadvantage since we only have one turret of 6\" guns facing rearward.</p> <p>!</p> <p>The F 57 Black Swan is an older frigate packing 4\" guns and with a much slower flank speed of 21 knots.\u00a0 If we were picking the liability, this would be it since it lacks the ability to concentrate fire like the cruiser does, and the 4\" guns, while they have a great rate of fire, only can hit targets 6 nm away.\u00a0 As a point of comparison, the 50-knot torpedo boat can cover 6 nm to 3 nm range in 3 minutes and 36 seconds, leaving us a very tight window if the PTs are able to close.</p> <p>The CLAA Juneau is one of the best units of the scenario when it comes to firing arcs, as it has 6 5\" gun mounts along its length and each of those has a range of 9 nm.\u00a0 Unfortunately, since it is literally an hour away from the fight, we'll have to use it to mop up or to cut off the enemy retreat.</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1032-executing-the-mission","title":"10.3.2 Executing the Mission","text":"<p>The key tactic for this scenario will be keeping the enemy as far away as possible from our vessels, keeping our speed up, and making sure as many firing arcs as possible are open for the purposes of engagement.\u00a0 The two northern vessels need to be brought into a position where they can mutually support each other, and the southern vessel needs to get to the scene as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Unpause the scenario and give it a few moments to get the initial sightings, then press pause again.</p> <p>!</p> <p>There are also some shore batteries in the mix that we must stay away from.\u00a0 Checking the database indicates that they have a range of about 4 nautical miles.\u00a0 We could create a non-navigation zone around them if needed, but they are not as big a priority as the incoming attackers.</p> <p>Select each of your vessels and turn their surface search radars on.</p> <p>!</p> <p>While it is tempting to let one ship keep its radar on while the others do not for the purposes of denying the enemy intelligence, one of our objectives was to do a full sensor sweep.\u00a0 Let's see what our radars uncovered.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Wow.\u00a0 That's a few ships.\u00a0 Luckily our HF/DF crew on board the vessels have immediately picked out the emissions of several 2D Short-Range radars.\u00a0 From what we know about the units in this scenario, the only ships with that type of radar are the torpedo boats, making it very easy to identify them as hostile.\u00a0 Click each of the ships with the Air &amp; Surface Search, 2D Short-Range radar and press H to mark them as hostile.\u00a0 You'll notice when you hold your mouse over them, that the ESM crew has already marked them as PT.</p> <p>Now that the enemy is identified, we can start maneuvers.\u00a0 Get all of your ships up to flank speed and maneuver the Jamaica towards the frigate while sending the Black Swan while bringing the course of the Black Swan towards the cruiser.\u00a0 The Juneau to the south should be plotted to get into the action, and we'll tweak that a little later on depending on what the opponent does.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Our goal here is to beam the enemy forces as best we can while building up enough speed to put some distance between us and the deadly torpedoes.\u00a0 While we're doing this, we'll take a quick visit the Doctrine &amp; ROE for side: United Nations (Control - Shift - F9) and set \"Engage Opportunity Targets\" to yes.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Now we'll unpause and monitor the action for a minute.\u00a0 The closest enemy to one of our ships is about 5.5 nm away, giving us only a few minutes to destroy the incoming vessels before they get into firing range.</p> <p>Notice what happens as the battle starts:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Four other vessels immediately point at us and start raising steam.\u00a0 If we check with our distance measuring tool, we can actually see they are following an intercept course with our vessels.</p> <p>While this is initially concerning, we can probably assume those vessels are the armed junks and while they are dangerous at very close range, we'd rather our cruise prioritize the incoming PTs before declaring them hostile and wasting firing effort on something that is less of a threat than the torpedoes that may follow.</p> <p></p> <p>We can see the 6\" shells from the cruise bracketing the incoming PT boat.\u00a0 Even though the shells were not direct hits, the concussion can still do a lot of damage.\u00a0 Making five enemy units combat ineffective is better than destroying one and leaving the other four still ready to go.</p> <p>It is possible using manual targeting to 'force' the ship to select a new target while shells are on the way, but this can be very difficult to manage in a very pitched naval battle.</p> <p>!</p> <p>You can see how the cruiser splits its fire automatically since it has multiple director control towers and associated radars regardless of our need to manually target.</p> <p>!</p> <p>We now know what to look for.</p> <p>!</p> <p>There it is.\u00a0 The enemy convoy has spotted us and is turning to flee to the south.\u00a0 Luckily, we have Juneau on the way to block their retreat.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Move the targeted destination slightly southward to cover the distance quicker.\u00a0 But do not come within 4 nm of the beach, or you may be attacked by shore batteries.</p> <p>!</p> <p>One PT down, 4 to go.\u00a0 If needed, keep the ships perpendicular to the incoming line of enemy fire.\u00a0 This strategy will keep true all the way into the near future with the advent of high-speed anti-ship missiles.</p> <p>You may notice the firing rate of the cruise suddenly drops off at this point in the battle.\u00a0 This is not due to battle damage, but rather if we take a quick look at the weapons tab of the Jamaica we can see:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Gun warfare with naval vessels involves a lot of 'hurry up and wait', and modern warfare is no different.\u00a0 As the battle continues, you may see something like this occur:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Notice how the Jamaica was busy engaging the other two vessels and missed one coming up the center.\u00a0 A quick check with the range tool tells us that they knew skunk is 4 nautical miles away.\u00a0 Luckily the Black Swan is just coming into range with its own 4\" guns and we can click it, press F1 then select the straggler for automatic targeting.\u00a0 It is very tempting to turn the Black Swan perpendicular to the incoming vessel to open up the rear guns to fire, but this would cut into our time needed to close the distance to Jamaica which could become problematic.</p> <p>!</p> <p>As we discussed in the briefing, mutual support is critical when dealing with gun-based vessels.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Note how all these other vessels turned to intercept us while the group to the south head East.\u00a0 Adjust the course of Juneau to intercept.</p> <p>!</p> <p>You will also notice one vessel that seems to be doing its own thing.\u00a0 This could be an enemy or could be a civilian, and without the presence of any HF/DF on them, we will have to visually identify them later before we close for a kill.\u00a0 Mark the other vessels on an intercept with us as hostile.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Note that both our vessels are working together now, but also observe how those unknown vessels are rushing out to sea.\u00a0 We have to finish up with the lighter enemy vessels first, then we can go for the runners.\u00a0 Remember our southern vessel is steaming up to assist us.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Adjusting our cruise to cut off the retreat.\u00a0 Notice how the western most vessel is slipping out of range; you can tell Jamaica to hit it with the 6\" guns or break the Black Swan off to do the deed.\u00a0 Also note that the two vessels are falling out of formation and will need some manual speed adjustments, or to be put in a group to keep them together.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Note that Juneau has started firing on the town marker.\u00a0 We do not want that since it will result in a major loss of ammunition for no gain.\u00a0 In COMMAND, objects like cities and towns require much heavier ordnance.</p> <p>You can quickly shut down the unwanted shelling by right clicking on the town marker and selecting \"Filter Out\".\u00a0 This will cause your ships to ignore the target until you reactivate them.</p> <p>At this point we can either run out the clock to end the scenario or if we're feeling a little more daring, we can set our ships up to shore the very shore batteries we were originally sent to attack, but this is actually out of the scope of the scenario.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Cleaning up the shore batteries.\u00a0 Remember that these shore batteries have a range of 4 nm and will happily set fire to any vessel that gets too close to shore.</p> <p>We can use time acceleration to run out the clock and see how we did in the scenario.\u00a0 An interesting point to visit with this run was the Losses &amp; Expenditures page under the \"Game\" menu.</p> <p>!</p> <p>And of course there's the final scoring page as well:</p> <p>!</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1033-conclusions-and-discussion","title":"10.3.3 Conclusions and Discussion","text":"<p>While the

very challenging operation and at the same time an excellent introduction to the challenges inherent in anti-submarine warfare.\u00a0 You may have to retry this scenario several times before achieving the scenario goals as this scenario features random placement of the enemy submarines creating a situation where you may score a lucky win one round or complete destruction on another.</p> <p>Take a look at the briefing:</p> <p>!</p> <p>We see that we have our work cut out for us. There are three \"potential\" escorts and each of these is a very capable Russian attack submarine.\u00a0 Our target is the PLARB-941 Typhoon, the largest submarine ever built and was designed from the outset to be able to pop through arctic ice and deliver its deadly load of 20 SS-N-20 nuclear weapons, each with 10 MIRV.\u00a0 Our submarine for this scenario is the SSN 768 Hartford, an Improved Los Angeles Class nuclear attack submarine.</p> <p>Our goal in this scenario is to destroy the Russian missile sub, even if it costs us our submarine in the process.\u00a0 Destroying the other Russian attack subs is nice but not needed for this scenario.</p> <p>As in our other scenarios, we'll carefully browse the scenario units and see if there are any things we can discover about the units that we will be encountering.\u00a0 After looking carefully, there are many things you may discover:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Russian subs primary anti-submarine torpedo is the USET-80K and     it has a default range of 5 nm, and its seeker is only sensitive out     to 1.5 nm.\u00a0 This means our primary anti-torpedo strategy will     involve turning and running to get out of its effective cone.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Russian submarines also possess a long-range standoff torpedo     that is delivered by missile, a weapon that cannot be used due to     the presence of the ice above our heads.\u00a0 This is the luckiest break     we have in this scenario.</p> </li> <li> <p>All of the Russian submarines have a towed array sonar system     meaning they can hear things both behind it as well as underneath it     since the hydrophone is trailed behind the submarine away from its     noisy propeller.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Mk48 Mod 5 ADCAP torpedo is our primary weapon, and it has a     staggering range of 21 nautical miles making it a fantastic 'recon     by fire' weapon.\u00a0 It also does 270 damage points.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Typhoon is both double hulled and it possesses 75 damage points,     which is less than our torpedo is capable of inflicting, but the     Typhoon is also well armored meaning it may take more than one clean     hit to do the deed.</p> </li> <li> <p>The SSN Hartford is a very capable platform with a top speed of 32     knots and several different types of towed arrays.\u00a0 It is also 10 dB     quieter than any of the Russian subs, giving us a huge stealth     advantage.\u00a0 This also means that if we detect a Russian sub first,     we will almost certainly get the first shot.</p> </li> <li> <p>The patrol area we are covering is 50 nm x 60 nm (30000 square     nautical miles of ocean).\u00a0 If we split that into 10-mile-wide     corridors of search that are 60 nm long, at 5 knots, it would take     us 14 hours to complete one sweep.\u00a0 Since we only have 48 hours to     complete the mission, this is not viable.</p> </li> </ol> <p>As we can see, this is going to be very tricky but it's not impossible.\u00a0 We have a few basic strategies available to us:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Conduct an ASW mission in the 'center' of the patrol area</p> </li> <li> <p>Build a search pattern using sprint and drift</p> </li> <li> <p>Drive our submarine into the search area and fire a spread of     torpedoes in every direction while listening</p> </li> <li> <p>Run full speed through the search area attracting torpedo attacks     and then firing on the bearing of incoming attacks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>When deciding between possibilities, it sometimes helps to create a risk chart:</p> Option Chance of Success Risk to us Complexity ASW Mission Low Low Low Sprint and Drift Medium Medium High Torpedo spread Low Low Low Full Speed Ahead! Medium High Low <p>The usual balance is between success and risk.\u00a0 We want the highest chance to succeed, but the one that minimizes losses on our side.\u00a0 Note how strategies that are often lower risk are either less effective and/or less complex.\u00a0 This is no surprise and it's why there are military colleges dedicated to these subjects.</p> <p>We will opt for two of the strategies, the sprint and drift and the torpedo spread.\u00a0 If we are running out of time in the scenario, we'll engage in a high-speed torpedo dodging exercise.\u00a0 Remember as we said in the introduction, even if we get everything perfect, we may still fail the scenario.\u00a0 ASW is as much about art as it is science, and in other ASW style scenarios, even with the presence of more assets and powerful passive tools such as sonobuoys.</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1042-executing-the-mission","title":"10.4.2 Executing the Mission","text":"<p>Loading the map, we can see:</p> <p>!</p> <p>The markers to the East of us represent the possible submarine patrol area and are where we need to start looking.\u00a0 We have to get there as quickly as possible so we will order our vessel to the patrol zone at full speed and maximum depth possible.\u00a0 Once we get to the patrol area, we'll prepare our sprint and drift patrol after listening.\u00a0 While it is tempting to start our patrol in the upper left or bottom left corner, bisecting the patrol zone will improve the chances of us finding our quarry.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Our towed array is trailed behind and below us, but our own submarine noises will make it hard to hear 'through' us.\u00a0 Although we have a powerful sonar array on the fore of the submarine, we'll want to swing around often to listen.</p> <p>!</p> <p>At anything under 10 knots, we have a good balance of speed and the ability to hear things around us.\u00a0 The faster we travel, the more noise we will make and the harder it will be to pick out the sounds of quiet submarines in our vicinity.</p> <p>At this point we may encounter a possible contact, but this is unlikely given the size of the search area.\u00a0 If we do get the distinctive unknown subsurface contact, we can start working out our first shot immediately.\u00a0 Otherwise, it's time to set up the sprint and drift.</p> <p>Our method will be to sprint about 10 nm at maximum depth and then drop our speed to 10 knots and then return to shallow depth for five minutes of listening and a quick 90 degree turn to clear our own baffles.\u00a0 5 minutes at 10 knots works out to be about 0.42 nautical miles which means we'll spend a quarter mile going forward and then a quarter mile at the perpendicular course.</p> <p>Start by drawing a 10 nm course, then selecting our submarine and setting the depth to \"As deep as possible\" and the speed to flank.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Then click on the end waypoint and press F3 to continue the pattern forward about 0.25 nm and then north 0.25 nm</p> <p>!</p> <p>Now select the waypoint on the left (Waypoint #1 and set the depth to shallow and the speed to 10 knots)</p> <p>!</p> <p>Now our submarine will sprint to the waypoint, then come up to listen for a few minutes.\u00a0 All we have to do now is repeat the pattern on a macro level.</p> <p>!</p> <p>You can see as our submarine arrives; it heads back up to the surface for a listen.\u00a0 Do not be surprised if there is nothing there as sonar has limited range.\u00a0 We can continue this pattern of sprinting and listening at a much larger level.\u00a0 At this point, we have to consider what kind of search pattern we are going to use now that we have our depth and speeds worked out.</p> <p>In ASW, there are several basic patterns we can use:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Expanding box: make progressively longer legs away from a point in     the shape of a 'square spiral'</p> </li> <li> <p>Ladder: Track back and forth up and down an area similar to the     pattern someone mowing the lawn takes</p> </li> <li> <p>Sector: Head to an area and execute several 120 degree turns before     offsetting to another.</p> </li> <li> <p>Zig-Zag: As in a box, but without the square corners</p> </li> </ol> <p>Expanding box:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Ladder:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Sector:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Zigzag:</p> <p>!</p> <p>Notice how each pattern has a different level of coverage versus time spent.\u00a0 The ladder is very effective, but it takes the longest to execute while the sector search doesn't cover as much, but it allows for quicker transit. The zigzag gives us a good balance between transit time and coverage.\u00a0 The expanding box is very useful if we were dealing with a stationary target, but since we're dealing with moving targets, the time spent going back over the original terrain won't help us.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what makes our decision tougher is our need to sprint and drift along the length of the pattern we create.\u00a0 We can either meticulously place each waypoint along our route, or we can opt for manual control of the submarine.\u00a0 Manual control also means we can react to anything we find along the route without having to redraw our entire route.</p> <p>When trying this scenario, experiment with the different patterns.\u00a0 For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll opt for the expanding box and use manual control of our submarine.\u00a0 To make things a little easier for us, we'll build a simple system to keep track of when to sprint and when to surface and listen:</p> <p>Time past the hour       Depth                      Speed</p> <p>+0:00                    As deep as possible        Flank/32 knots</p> <p>+0:20                    Shallow                    Creep/8 knots</p> <p>+0:30                    As deep as possible        Flank/32 knots</p> <p>+0:50                    Shallow                    Creep/8 knots</p> <p>This is also handy in case we encounter an enemy submarine, and we need to determine where we were in the cycle.</p> <p>After setting up our pattern, we can see it will take us about 14 hours to cover the entire shape at flank, and with our adjustments we can expect that to be pretty close to 24 or so.</p> <p>!</p> <p>!</p> <p>Our drawn pattern.</p> <p>Now all that is left is to make our adjustments as we go along.\u00a0 You'll now see what ASW is also known as 'awfully slow warfare'.\u00a0 It may take us a literal two days in game time and still not see one of the four enemy submarines, or we will see all four at once, that's why it is so challenging.</p> <p>!</p> <p>ALARM!\u00a0 We've got something during one of our sweeps.\u00a0 Our sonar team was on their a-game and worked this contact out to be our quarry!\u00a0 This was incredibly lucky on our part, but just because we have a positive contact and ID, we still need to engage the enemy submarine.</p> <p>Our range to the target is 3.37 nautical miles meaning our 50 knot torpedoes can cover that distance in about four minutes.\u00a0 The moment we fire, the typhoon will likely drop a rack of their own torpedoes down our bearing, but if you recall, their range is only 5 nautical miles giving us plenty of time to get outside of their detection range.</p> <p>Hold down shift+F1 and left click on the target</p> <p>!</p> <p>Although it is tempting to fire all four torpedoes at the target, typical submarine doctrine calls for always holding one torpedo in reserve for self-defense.\u00a0 After all, there could be a Russian sub right behind us!</p> <p>Since our range is so close, we can take a direct shot rather than firing a carefully aimed spread.\u00a0 Remember the default reaction to hearing a torpedo is turning and running from it meaning if we miss, we now have a target that is several miles away from us and out of range from a follow up shot, so we'll have to pursue them remembering that we will be making a lot of noise in the process.\u00a0 We'll have to run deep and fast and constantly track where our target is.</p> <p>Fire two of the torpedoes and notice immediately that you lose sight of the Typhoon.\u00a0 This is because your torpedoes are the loudest things in the water and they are between you and your target, you can either manually steer the torpedoes out of your line of sight (they are wire guided and can be controlled with the plot course command), or you can beam them until you reacquire the target.\u00a0 Remember they will run away from the incoming torpedoes, so we need to be where they are going.</p> <p>!</p> <p>Since our torpedoes are so noisy, we can easily track the position of the enemy sub by the direction the torpedoes point and their path of travel.\u00a0 Turning on unit trails is a great way to visualize the path of the weapon.\u00a0 This is under options -&gt; Map Display.</p> <p>!</p> <p>!</p> <p>Those Mark 48 torpedoes are incredible weapons, and you can see how it was a very clean kill leaving us with one torpedo still tracking.\u00a0 That torpedo can turn and come back to us if we are noisy, so be careful not to get too close to it.\u00a0 A common strategy here is using the wire to plot a course of the weapon away from our own submarine, but this can cause collateral damage!</p> <p>In this scenario, it is very tempting to keep hunting for the other Russian submarines, but an order is an order.\u00a0 The BRAVO ZULU is a naval shorthand for 'well done'.\u00a0 Getting out of this area is quite easy since we can get down deep and run at creep speed until we are clear of the patrol zone.\u00a0 Remember that there are still several attack subs around us, and they may have heard us and are vectoring in to engage.</p> <p>!</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#1043-conclusions-and-discussion","title":"10.4.3 Conclusions and Discussion","text":"<p>Whether or not you were able to sink the boomer in the time allotted, the scenario provided you with a few great ways to approach anti-submarine warfare:</p> <ol> <li> <p>You can execute the mission perfectly and still miss your mark</p> </li> <li> <p>If you can hit your opponent, they can hit you.\u00a0 This is not as true     with aerial assets, but still relevant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Detection is a function of speed and depth.\u00a0 The faster you are, the     harder it is to hear but you will also be easier to be heard.</p> </li> <li> <p>A search pattern is easier to execute when you have multiple assets     at your disposal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sonar can be easily masked by your own vessel, weapons or other     objects in the water making detection very challenging.</p> </li> </ol> <p>One thing we did not cover in the scenario write-up is the event that you are engaged by an enemy torpedo.\u00a0 The first thing you should do is launch one of your own torpedoes using a bearing only launch in the direction the torpedo was launched from while simultaneously marking where that weapon was when it was first detected.\u00a0 This will allow you to plan your re-attack after turning around and running at flank speed away from the torpedo.\u00a0 If a torpedo is fired at you beyond effective range, it is often easier to plot a course perpendicular from the incoming weapon to proceed out of the detection cone of it, also providing you with quality targeting information.</p>"},{"location":"example-scenario/#105-aaw-example-to-be-completed","title":"10.5 AAW Example -- To be completed.","text":""},{"location":"faqs/","title":"FAQs, Resources, and Learning:","text":"FAQ: What books are recommended for understanding modern naval warfare? <p>The following books provide excellent background knowledge for Command players:</p> <p>Foundational Texts:</p> <ul> <li>Fleet Tactics and Coastal Combat by CAPT Wayne Hughes, USN (Ret.) - The definitive work on modern naval tactics.

It scales up to the operational/theater level, where logistics, turn-around cycles, intelligence, force allocation, and mission tasking dominate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wargame/simulation: Command straddles the line between a traditional wargame and a professional military simulation. Player success depends not on reflexes or \"gameplay balance\", but on understanding real capabilities, limitations, and operational trade-offs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Joint, all-domain operations: Command demonstrates how land, sea, air, space, strategic and cyber forces work together rather than in isolation. The player synchronizes disparate forces across domains and time to achieve tactical and operational objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Post-WW2 to the near future: Command covers military operations from the post-WW2 colonial drawdown and beginning of the 1st Cold War all the way to today's hotspots and the foreseen battlefields of tomorrow.</p> </li> </ul> FAQ: Do I need military experience to play? <p>Many Command players have military backgrounds, but the game is also played by regular enthusiasts with a fascination for all-domain warfare. The developmental efforts have focused on making the game easy to operate, with a rich variety of tutorial scenarios that help players learn basic concepts of modern warfare as well as the user interface.</p> <p>Command is not an arcade game with visually stunning explosions. It requires a significant investment of intellectual and temporal capital, and is not for everyone. However, if you really want to understand modern integrated warfare, this is your first choice according to many players.</p> FAQ: Is Command a true 3D simulation? <p>Yes. Command is a full 3D simulated environment using a true 3D planet globe. While the default view is top-down 2D, you can raise the camera viewpoint altitude to see the full 3D nature of the simulation. Satellites and all aerospace units are depicted at their correct altitudes with dashed \"beanstalks\" showing their vertical position.</p> FAQ: Does Command have multiplayer? <p>Real-time and WEGO-style multiplayer modes are currently available only in Command-PE (Professional Edition). For CMO there is an unofficial third-party mod which offers PBEM-style multiplayer. Real-time multiplayer for CMO is under development.</p> FAQ: How does Command compare to games like Dangerous Waters? <p>Dangerous Waters, Sub Command etc. are more low-level tactical, \"levers and buttons\" simulations. Command assumes that the AI crew handles many housekeeping tasks (resolving bearing ambiguity of passive sonar, performing TMA, etc.) so you can focus on the tactical picture, much like in Microprose's classic \"Red Storm Rising.\"</p> <p>Command's scope is that of a grand tactical/operational commander. You manage forces while many tactical functions are handled by the AI, though you can take manual control to plot courses, set speeds/depths and fire weapons. This higher-level modeling allows Command to scale to much greater theaters and unit numbers than practical in \"study\" sims.</p> FAQ: Are WW2 scenarios possible? <p>Yes, with certain limitations. Many WW2 technologies (depth charges, straight-running torpedoes, mines, unguided munitions) are modeled since they also saw use in the Cold War era. Many WW2 platforms are available in the Cold War Database (CWDB, 1946-1979).</p> <p>However, some WW2-specific elements are not yet modeled: plunging shell fire, \"crossing the T\" tactics, and diesel subs without snorkels. If these details don't distract you, you can have a lot of fun with WW2 scenarios.</p> <p>Entering COMMAND, there are four main game modes.</p> <p>Game Modes:</p> <p>Campaign. This game mode allows for the playing of multi-mission campaigns, such as the official DLCs or tutorials. See 5.4.3 Campaigns on page 83, for more information.</p> <p>Quick Battle. This game mode allows for players to throw together a \"quick battle\" from a list of presets. Thus, you can choose between F-16s and F-22s on one side and Su-35s or MiG-29s on the other for an easy to execute dogfight, or a submarine matchup involving a Los Angeles or Virginia vs. Victor III or Akula.</p> <p>Start New Game. This loads a prebuilt scenario. This can be considered \"normal play\". Players can select a side if the scenario allows it, but all ScenEdit features are disabled.</p> <p>Create New Scenario. This allows for a scenario to be created. All ScenEdit features are enabled.</p> <p>The gigantic amount of community content for COMMAND and its complexity may be daunting to beginners. Completing the formal tutorials, some new to CMO and some carried over from 1.0, in order is highly recommended. In addition to those, the following \"standalone scenarios\" are useful for learning the basics of COMMAND.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Battle of Chumonchin Chan, 1950. This is a basic Korean War scenario   where the player controls an objectively superior force to their   opponent. Useful for learning gun-dominant surface warfare.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wooden Leg, 1985. This is another basic long-range Israeli airstrike   scenario where the only challenge is aerial refueling to get the   aircraft to the target. Useful for learning how to use tanker   aircraft.</p> </li> <li> <p>Raid on Kismayo, 2013. This is a basic low-intensity modern warfare   scenario. Useful for general play and control in a generally low-risk   environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Battle of Latakia, 1973. This is a historically lopsided encounter   that serves as an excellent introduction to missile-age surface   warfare. Useful for learning missile-dominant surface warfare.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stand Up, 2011. This is, especially if played from the British side,   an easy scenario that nonetheless forces the player to coordinate   aircraft and ships. Useful for getting the hang of combined arms   operations.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once the basics have been mastered, the following are recommended for somewhat more advanced play:</p> <ul> <li> <p>North Pacific Shootout, 1989. A small-scale air-to-air scenario   between the best the US and Soviet Union have to offer. Useful for   fighting a peer air opponent in a manageable situation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iron Hand, 2014. A Russia-vs-Azerbaijan scenario that teaches the   basics of standoff weapons, a detailed air campaign, and operating in   a casualty-conscious environment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The community pack, available at https://command.matrixgames.com/?page_id=1876, contains hundreds of scenarios available for download. Many are beginner-friendly. A helpful rule of thumb is to search for ones with low 'complexity' on the difficulty-complexity scale.</p> <p>Disclaimer: The community pack scenario authors have varying degrees of contactability and support of their scenarios. Thus, some scenarios may not be updated or changed to take mechanics changes since their introduction into account. Play at your own risk.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#21-important-terms","title":"2.1 Important Terms","text":"<p>There are several bits of information those in a hurry to get started need to know. These will be elaborated in greater detail throughout this manual and the tutorials.</p> <p>Units (Page 56): Units are the entities in the simulation. There are many types of units and many of these units can house other units; for example, an aircraft carrier can house aircraft, or an airbase can have hanger units, runway units, and these hanger units may contain aircraft units. Many units can be directly controlled or assigned to missions. There are special units such as individual facilities, sonobuoys, missiles, and many weapon types that may or may not be directly controlled and cannot be assigned a mission. Airbases can be assigned missions.</p> <p>Groups (Page 56): Groups are units that have been bound/grouped together in the simulation into one cohesive unit. This is done by drag-selecting units and pressing the G key. Many scenarios come with groups pre-made by the scenario creator, and aerial missions automatically group aircraft based on the mission editor's flight size.</p> <p>Mounts (Page 36): Many units have mounts. These are usually weapons or sensors. An example would be a gun mount on a ship, a hard point on an aircraft, or a sonobuoy dispenser on an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter. Mounts usually require ammunition that is already loaded, such as a missile on an aircraft (single shot mount) or a gun mount with a magazine associated with it for reload. There are ways to reload mounts and magazines if the scenario designer desires to provide loaded ammunition bunkers, ships' magazines for aircraft or at-sea replenishment for ships.</p> <p>Magazines (Page 30): These are components of units that are used to store weapons. These must have weapons in them for weapons to fire or aircraft to launch combat-oriented missions.</p> <p>Missions (Page 144): Missions make the battle space manageable and allows the scenario designer to set up an effective AI controlled opponent. The purpose of missions is to allow units or groups of units to engage in a common task, such as anti-submarine warfare or all striking one target. There are many mission types and mission options, such as Rules of Engagement, Doctrine and Postures.</p> <p>Formations (Page 29): Formations are a group of units (normally associated with ships, but may be extended to aircraft formations), a central unit(s) and escorts. Each unit in the formation usually has a primary task and station, designed to mutually support the whole formation from any threat.</p> <p>Rules of engagement (RoE) and Doctrine (Page 38 and 61): This also encompasses mission options and orders. Many units house other units, like a cruiser with an embarked ASW helicopter. The cruiser is assigned a mission or patrol zone within a formation which has a specific EMCON (Emissions Condition, i.e. whether its radar is on or off). If the embarked helicopter is not assigned a specific mission, it will inherit the Rules of Engagement, Doctrine and EMCON of the parent unit (the cruiser), this can be overridden if you decide to change any of the aforementioned settings (you will be prompted to affirm the override).</p> <p>You can skip right to the tutorials or read further for more detailed information on the items above.</p> <p>Events (Page 93): Events allow fundamental changes in the battlespace, such as changing the player's score, launching or cancelling a mission, or even ending the scenario entirely. Events consist of a trigger (cue to start them, which can be a point threshold, unit hit/found, or time point) and an action (the meat of the event itself, which can be everything from a basic \"Side ___ scores X number of points\" to a complex Lua script). Events are created by the scenario author in the scenario editor and are not viewable or editable in regular play.</p> <p>Sensors (page 195): Sensors are anything that allows a unit to detect something else. They range from the classic \"Mark 1 Eyeball\" to advanced radars and electronic emission detectors. Sensors can be passive (no emissions of their own) or active (which do emit, and thus can be detected by other passive sensors)</p> <p>Types of sensors include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Radar. The most famous 'active' sensor system. Radars range from the   earliest and crudest World War II vintage types to ultra-modern AESAs   (Active Electronically Scanned Arrays). Radar performance, especially   in the face of jammers, can thus vary extensively based on power and   technology. On one extreme are early radars that can only generate an   imprecise general contact location, while on the other are advanced   ones that are incredibly jamming resistant and can determine the exact   type of target they're identifying.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sonar. Sound-based naval detection system, sonar can be 'passive'   (purely listening) or active (pinging). Active sonar is more precise   but lets the target know that someone else is there. As with radars,   sonar performance varies extensively by size and technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Electro-Optical. This includes video cameras and infrared sensors.   While they have their limitations (such as only being able to   determine precise distances at short range), they have the advantage   of being 'passive' and thus not emitting like radars are.</p> </li> <li> <p>ESM. Electronic Support Measures, these range from simple radar   detectors to advanced signals processors. All share the   characteristics of being 'passive' (not emitting themselves) and being   able to detect active radar emissions.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#22-fundamentals","title":"2.2 Fundamentals","text":""},{"location":"introduction/#221-starting-command","title":"2.2.1 Starting COMMAND","text":"<p>Start command by either clicking on the Desktop Shortcut or on the Command.EXE file in the Command folder.

See 3.3.2 Engage Target(s) -- Manual on page 24 for more information.</p> <p>Bearing-Only Attack: The bearing only attack allows players to fire guided weapons without designating a target but instead designating a point which their guiding sensor(s) will activate to hunt targets. It otherwise functions identically to the \"engage target(s)-manual\" function.</p> <p>Be aware that doing this may put neutrals at risk as the sensor may not know friend from foe and that it has a high chance of missing, especially if the contact location is not accurate. You can also call on this function using Ctrl+F1 hotkey combo or from the Unit Orders drop down menu. (For purely inertial-guided weapons, like ballistic missiles or JDAM-type bombs, the designated point is not the seeker-activation point but rather the desired impact point. This can be useful if, for example, you want to finetune the airburst point of a cluster warhead.)</p> <p>Lay Chaff: This function has the aircraft deploy a cloud of anti-radar chaff. The \"single burst\" option releases one 'puff', while 'continuous stream' has the aircraft deploy chaff until it runs out or has to RTB for another reason. The corridor and its altitude are marked on the map.</p> <p>Aircraft inside the corridor have an effectively reduced RCS (the chaff strips break up the radar beam and scatter it wildly), but it is dependent on them staying inside it. Improvements in radar quality made chaff increasingly less effective in real life, as aircraft would be confined to a narrow corridor with increasingly marginal benefits from it.</p> <p>Note that the aircraft must be inside the corridor (and at the same altitude as the cloud when faced with 3D radars), not merely behind it. Chaff-droppers must therefore precede the main body, an inherently dangerous task (many F-4 crews assigned to such a role in Vietnam found this out the hard way.)</p> <p>From the late 1970s onward, chaff sharply drops in effectiveness. 3D and phased-array systems, along with better electronics overall, can make radars more capable at seeing through it.

The submarine will automatically raise the snorkel, start diesel generators, and recharge batteries. Set throttle to creep for faster recharge.</p> FAQ: How do I deploy towed array sonar? <p>Towed arrays deploy automatically in deep enough water. If you see faint Convergence Zone (CZ) rings around your ship/sub, you have a towed array operational.</p> FAQ: How is submarine communications handled? <p>All platform-to-platform communication is instantaneous in Command. You can actively control units and share information even when it would be impossible in real life. Command supports communications disruption and jamming models for more realistic scenarios.</p> FAQ: How do I get helicopters or aircraft to search for submarines? <p>Define an area using reference points. Create a \"Patrol/ASW\" mission and assign the vessels, helicopters, or aircraft to that mission.</p> FAQ: My submarine depth orders are being ignored. Why? <p>If assigned to an ASW or Sea Control mission, the mission logic dictates speed and depth. Use U to unassign the unit from the mission. For more manual control, turn off automatic evasion in ROE settings.</p> FAQ: Why don't my ASW aircraft drop torpedoes until they're right on top of the target? <p>Real-life ASW tactics. If you drop a torpedo from far away, it uses much of its fuel reaching the target position, and an alert submarine captain has time to clear datum at high speed. Dropping close gives the torpedo the best chance of catching the submarine.</p> <p>Missions and reference points are the vital building blocks of COMMAND.

The various mission types can have sub-types and their own Doctrine/ROE and EMCON settings. Missions are either Area Oriented or Task Oriented. Area Oriented missions such as Patrol Missions are defined by Reference Points, Task oriented missions such as Strike are defined by target units.</p> <p>Missions are one of the fundamental simulation constructs in Command, both from a UI perspective and from a simulation engine point of view. They provide three key elements:</p> <p>1)  Abstraction of control: Without missions, a player/user has to     issue precise instructions to each and every unit present in a     scenario and must also update those orders as the situation changes.     This can easily grow into micromanagement hell in a scenario with     thousands of units to control. Units under mission tasking will     independently navigate, move, change their EMCON settings, detect,     engage the enemy and withdraw to host bases (if applicable) under     their mission AI logics.</p> <p>2)  Control &amp; behavior of units not under human control: When using     Command in single-player mode, it is necessary to \"program\"     non-friendly units in order to instruct their behavior. Again,     precise instructions are tedious to issue and can rapidly become     outdated as the tactical/operational picture develops. Missions     allow issuing general directions to computer-controlled units and     then have them execute them on their own accord.</p> <p>3)  Behavior variability: Giving precise manual orders means the     units will follow them to the letter (unless disrupted by the enemy,     the weather, the environment etc.). This is often undesired as it     makes their behavior too predictable. Units operating under a     mission tasking will display greater variability in the execution of     their mission.</p>"},{"location":"missions/#71-mission-editor","title":"7.1 Mission Editor","text":"<p>The mission editor provides a list of all current missions, and it also gives you the ability to create, edit and manage them.

This allows true-to-life positioning of pier facilities without having to flatten the terrain data around them in order to make them accessible.</p> <p>{width=\"6.138888888888889in\" height=\"3.1527777777777777in\"}</p> <p>The light-shadow polygon is the \"pier lane\" area projected by the multiple pier facilities inland. Ships and submarines can freely traverse this area (even though terrain is nominally present) to navigate in and out of the piers.</p> <p>Once a ship docks to a pier (or parent ship), the process of refuel, repair and replenishment begins. Both refueling and rearming happen at faster rates than on UNREP hookups as the docking condition allows for a stabler environment and more extended facilities and tooling. In addition, while a ship underway can perform repairs only to minor component damage and cannot repair structural damage, docked units can perform repairs on medium- and heavily-damaged systems, and can also repair their structures. Docked ships/subs can re-arm from either magazines on the pier itself or ammo facilities belonging to the same group (i.e. naval base) as the pier, just like with ammo bunkers on airbases.</p> <p>Pier side replenishment rates are modeled after real-life restrictions on size &amp; weight. Light weapons can be loaded quite fast, but heavier weapons (particularly heavy gun shells or large bombs, missiles or rockets) can take hours to transfer and load.</p> <p>Readying a ship for redeployment differs from aircraft turnaround in a number of ways. Ship preparation typically takes far longer than aircraft (except for very small boats), and in contrast to an aircraft, a ship is perfectly able to put to sea again while still in far from optimal condition. Accordingly, the player can order one or more ships to redeploy while they still have damage or miss weapons and fuel.</p> <p>To enable the AI to make reasonable decisions on withdrawal &amp; redeployment thresholds, a dedicated set of doctrine settings are available: Withdraw &amp; Redeploy criteria.</p> <p>{width=\"6.180555555555555in\" height=\"4.027777777777778in\"}</p> <p>The status of each of those aspects is continuously tracked and evaluated against the doctrine threshold and a ship will withdraw from its mission if any of the withdrawal criteria are reached. Conversely, while docked, these criteria are regularly checked, and a ship is allowed (by the AI) to re-sortie only if everything is \"green across the board\". The player of course can still order any ship to sail immediately regardless of its condition.</p> <p>These new settings allow tailoring the withdraw and redeploy behavior of a ship to its unique strengths / weaknesses as well as to the needs of her mission tasking. For example, an anti-aircraft escort may be set to ignore depletion of its offensive weapons, fuel and any damages to itself and withdraw from the line only when its defensive (AAW) armament is depleted. Conversely, a sensitive high-value unit may be configured to withdraw immediately on the first scratch of damage.</p> <p>{width=\"6.152777777777778in\" height=\"1.6944444444444444in\"}</p> <p>The redeployment criteria allow the player (or scenario author) to make his own decisions on how \"ready\" he wants his ships to put out to sea again: Does he wait until every last bit of ammo is restocked? Is it enough to repair damage and get refueled? Obviously, there is no single \"best\" answer, and the theater/operational exigencies (as well as time pressure) are likely to force the player to make decisions that he is not entirely happy with. Real-life ops are very often a compromise, and Command reflects this.</p> <p>When putting out from a pier to sea again, ships/subs first navigate to a point at the edges of the pier lane area and then re-plot for their destination.</p> <p>[NOTE #1: The definition of primary attack/defense weapon points to the longest-ranged ASuW weapon (attack) and AAW/ASW (defense) weapon and uses the default DB-fed values for reference. So, for example, if an Aegis cruiser is stocked with SM-2s on its DB-pristine version but the scenario author opts to clean them out and re-stock with TLAMs and a few ESSMs, the cruiser is considered as \"primary defense weapon exhausted\" even though it still has the ESSMs.]{.mark}</p> <p>[NOTE #2: The rules for picking the primary attack/defense weapon are slightly different for submarines. Hunter-killer subs (both nuclear and DE) consider torpedoes their primary weapon for both attack and defense even if they carry other longer-ranged weapons (missiles etc.). Cruise- and ballistic-missile subs however, consider their missiles their primary attack weapon.]{.mark}</p>"},{"location":"missions/#782-observing-and-cataloging-non-friendly-airdocking-ops","title":"7.8.2 Observing (and cataloging) non-friendly air/docking ops","text":"<p>Aircraft, ships and submarines can be spotted on their host facilities during a BDA/recon attempt by a friendly unit.

Of all the grand fleets of the past, only the United States and its former colonial master, now inseparable, stood intact. The Americans ruled over the sea as no power had before. The Victorian Royal Navy talked about a \"Two-power standard\" of matching the two next fleets. The Americans now enjoyed an \"every power standard\" courtesy of their smashing victory, a standard they have not been keen on letting slip. As fearsome as the Soviet Union was on land, its sea power was marginal immediately following the war.</p> <p>The age of the traditional fleet battle was over. Even had Stalin's big fleet program came to fruition, the American head start was simply too great. But there was another counter.</p> <p>The missile, the submarine, and the jet bomber served as a potential asymmetric counter to the carrier task force. As the Cold War intensified, all three of these found their way into the burgeoning Soviet Navy. Although the world fortunately never had to find out if the \"strike complex\" could overpower the carrier group, it nonetheless emerged as a distinct threat.</p> <p>This technological arms race produced some interesting systems. The Komar missile boat that sank the INS Eilat was both revolutionary and quickly obsolete. Anachronisms like HMS Vanguard and the reactivated Iowa's stood with oddballs like the carrier-launched U-2.</p> <p>The aircraft carrier meant that the increasing performance of aircraft could be harnessed in naval warfare, showing that all technologies are interrelated. The battleship had been sunk, with jets and anti-ship missiles finishing off what the propeller-driven carrier aircraft had mortally wounded in World War II. And one of the first major procurement battles of the Cold War, the so-called \"Revolt of the Admirals\" was over which service would take the lead in deploying the biggest game-changer of all: the nuclear bomb.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the proxy conflict between the superpowers was throwing gasoline on the fires ignited by the collapsing colonial empires. The story of modern war would be written here. A large intervention here, a small one there. The clash of two regional powers with the best gear their patrons could provide, the dance of two minnows armed with low-grade weapons. The defining conflict of missile-age sea war was fought over two islands. The carrier battles of World War II gave way to one near-miss that would have involved only three carriers at most.</p> <p>And the ever-present fear of nuclear war, of the Russo-American World War III, of the best of the best smashing against each other in an apocalyptic struggle, dominated everyone's mind.</p> <p>After a lull in the peace of the 1990s and unconventional war of the 2000s, the rise of China and oil-fueled resurgence of Russia brought the issue of naval technology back to the forefront. Now, the missile age has reached a new level, with weapons such as the Naval Strike Missile, Yakhont, and upcoming ones like the LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) and DF-21 ballistic missile reaching new limits of stealth, speed, and range.</p> <p>That was at sea.</p> <p>In the air, things were considerably more even. While the immediate postwar Soviet navy was a small afterthought, its air force was not. The jet age of aerial warfare started with a bang in Korea and never let up, with the newly independent United States Air Force having its bloody baptism of fire. The surface-to-air missile added a new element to the old struggle in one direction, and the smart bomb likewise in another.</p> <p>The period from Korea to Vietnam brought a focus on strategic capability as the superpowers relied on bomber aircraft as their primary deterrent before intercontinental ballistic missiles could get off the ground. This led to some flashes in the pan like the B-58 and M-4 Bison. It also led to enduring designs in use to the present day like the famous B-52 Stratofortress and Tu-95 Bear. The paradox of the chaotic 1945-1960 period for air power was that a \"cutting-edge\" aircraft could soon turn into an obsolete one-trick pony, while a seemingly less-capable one could stick around long after it was reduced to tossing standoff missiles against a peer opponent. The Stratofortress had conventional capability and endurance that has proved itself in every American war since Vietnam, while the Bear has excelled as a long-range patroller. Such paradoxes can be found across the services countries, with military platforms frequently outlasting their intended replacements.</p> <p>Lessons of the smaller regional wars, not just Vietnam and Korea, were studied and debated extensively. The Falklands and especially Arab-Israeli wars were scrutinized in massive detail. Exercises such as Red Flag brought an ever-increasing amount of realism to training.</p> <p>Thankfully, the brutal meatgrinder of aircraft and missiles over central Europe did not come to pass. What did emerge was the Gulf War, a battle with American aircrews facing an opponent with the exact technology that they had trained against for over a decade. The resulting one-sided battle cemented American dominance in the skies, at least for a time.</p> <p>Yet looking at air or naval power in isolation misses the point. Even as a branch, air or naval operations are simply one part of a bigger whole. And as with all combined arms, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Coordinated \"jointness\" is extremely difficult to achieve. Yet when it is achieved, the result is overwhelming dominance.</p> <p>This is the world of Command: Modern Operations. Reenact the battles of the wars that did happen, pushing packages of Thunderchief's over North Vietnam or sending F-117s over Baghdad. Explore the possibility of the wars that didn't happen, be they skirmishes over disputed borders or apocalyptic battles in the Fulda Gap. And speculate on the outcomes of wars that could happen, in the Spratly's, Baltic States, or wherever the imagination leads.</p>"},{"location":"preface/#what-is-command","title":"What is Command?","text":"<p>COMMAND is a 64-bit, pause-able, real-time joint operations wargame that that spans from shortly after World War II to the near future (1940s-2020s).

A blank world map should appear.</p> <p>-Move and zoom the map to the area of the world you want the scenario to take place in. While COMMAND allows for intercontinental travel, a beginner should start small. This step doesn't have to be taken now, but it doesn't hurt. Let's zoom in on Mauritania.</p> <p></p> <p>-Go to the Editor drop down menu. The first thing you should do is check the database. Since changing DBs wipes the rest of the scenario, the database should be decided on before any more work is done. There are two main databases, the DB3000 (1980+) and the CWDB (1946-1979). The DB3000 won't have World War II surplus fighters like P-38s, and the CWDB won't have advanced modern aircraft like F-22s. Here we want the DB3000, so select \"use latest DB3000.\"</p> <p></p> <p>-Now add a side. This will be the player's side. We'll just call it \"Blue\" for now. Go to Add/Edit Sides on the editor drop down menu, click add, type \"Blue\", and click \"OK.\"</p> <p></p> <p>It's time to add an airbase. Fortunately, COMMAND has many prebuilt ones. Go again to the editor drop-down menu, then go to \"import-export units\" and \"load units\". Go to \"main, import/export\", then scroll down to \"Mauritania\" and expand. Check the box that says \"Nouakchott IA\", and then press \"Load Selected Installation(s)\". Then close the window after it says \"completed!\"</p> <p></p> <p>A small airfield shall now appear on the Mauritanian west coast. Click on it.</p> <p></p> <p>Go to either \"Edit Aircraft\" in the Editor drop-down menu or press the \"Edit hosted aircraft\" button on the right bar with the airfield selected. The edit aircraft window will appear.</p> <p>Into \"Class\", type \"F-4S\".</p> <p>Two types of (functionally identical) units will appear. Select the lower (Navy) one, type \"Phantom\" for callsign, and enter 5 into \"how many\". Then press \"Add Selected\". Five F-4S Phantom IIs should appear in the \"current\" tab on the left. Close the window.</p> <p></p> <p>Now zoom close to the airbase. Go to either Editor Drop Down/Unit Actions/Add Unit or just press insert. The mouse cursor should change. Click on an area of land near the airbase.</p> <p>Select \"Facility\", then in the \"class\" box, type in \"Bar Lock\". Several types of Bar Lock radar will appear. Select one and press \"OK.\" A Bar Lock 3D air search radar station will appear at the spot. Click on the Bar Lock to select it. Note that in the Add new unit dialog, you have the ability to filter the desired units by class, subtype, country and whether the unit is real or hypothetical.</p> <p></p> <p>On the right bar, press \"Sensors\". Uncheck the \"Unit Obeys EMCON\" box and click the \"active\" box on the \"Bar Lock A\" option. Close the window. The radar is now emitting.</p> <p></p> <p>Now we need to arm the fighters. Reselect the airbase. Click on \"magazines\" on the right bar, then \"add weapons\". Add the 120 Sparrows and 48 Sidewinders (or any number, but those choices are the most convenient).</p> <p></p> <p>Close the windows and click on \"aircraft\" on the right bar. The five Phantoms are all red with \"no loadout\", meaning they cannot function. Select all of them, then press ready/arm. You'll notice in the air ops window that the air-to-air loadouts are functional, but the rest aren't. This is because only the air-to-air missiles are available in the magazines.</p> <p>Select \"A/A: AIM-7, Heavy\", and press the red \"ready immediately (ScenEdit) button\". While in normal mode they'd need time to prepare, here they're ready instantly. Now they appear as green, meaning they're ready to go.</p> <p></p> <p>All right, one side is up. It has a radar station for spotting and aircraft capable of intercepting. Now for the other.</p> <p>Go to Add/Edit Sides again, then add a side called \"Red\". Before closing the window, make sure to check the \"side is computer-only\" box. Now go to \"Switch To\" and select Red.</p> <p>The map is now blank again. Go to add unit/insert, click on a spot near the northern Mauritania/Western Sahara border, and type in \"Single-Unit Airfield\". Select one with a long runway and press OK. It should appear.</p> <p>Now press the play button for a few seconds and then pause the simulation again. Two green symbols-the Nouakchott airbase and Bar Lock, should appear. Green means neutral, and we want these to be hostile. Go back to add/edit sides. Click on Blue, go to Postures, and then select Hostile. Do the same for Red. They should now appear as red on the map.</p> <p></p> <p>Select the airfield (making sure you're controlling Red) and then click \"edit hosted aircraft\" on the right bar. Type in C-130A and select one of the two C-130As (NOT the AC-130A on the top). Write \"Target\" under callsign and add two.</p> <p>Go to \"planes\" and ready/arm again. Select Ferry and ready immediately. There's no need for filling the magazines in this case.</p> <p>They need missions to function. Using CRTL-right click or CRTL-Ins, put two reference points near, but not too near, the blue airbase. Make sure they're selected.</p> <p></p> <p>Now go to the missions/reference points drop down menu and add mission. Make it a support mission.</p> <p></p> <p>Select both C-130s and add them to the mission, then uncheck the 1/3rd rule.</p> <p></p> <p>Now save the game. If loaded in normal play, the scenario now functions-the C-130s will take off on their own. But now it's time to make it meaningful.</p> <p>Switch to Blue or exit and reopen the scenario (it will load as Blue by default, as Red is checked to computer-only). Go to Editor-Dropdown/Edit Scoring. Set the Triumph score to 150. Close the window.</p> <p></p> <p>Now go to Editor/Event Editor/Triggers. Select a \"create new trigger, unit is destroyed.\" Type in C-130 Shot Down. Select Target Side Red, Target Type Aircraft, Target Subtype Transport, Target Class C-130A Hercules. Press OK.</p> <p></p> <p>Now Editor/Event Editor/Actions. You want two actions this time. Select \"Create New Action\" with \"Points\", and then Side: Blue, Point Change 500, with Blue Points in the description. Press OK. Then select Create New Action with \"End Scenario\". Press OK in the now limited action editor window.</p> <p>Close the window, now go to Event Editor/Events.</p> <p>Check the Event is Repeatable Tab, Type in C-130 Hit for \"description\", then add C-130 Shot Down for trigger and \"Blue Points\" and \"End The Scenario\" for Action. Press OK. Save the scenario.</p> <p></p> <p>By this point, the internal mechanics of the scenario are complete. All that's left is touching it up.</p> <p>At the very top of the editor drop down menu is \"scenario times-duration\". Make sure the \"scenario current time\" and \"scenario start time\" are the same, set the \"complexity\" to 2 (for the sake of the exercise) and put \"Mauritania\" as the location. Then press OK.</p> <p>Now go to editor menu- \"Title/description\". This has probably already come up as part of the initial save of the scenario. In the description box, write \"Defend southern Mauritania from unknown red contacts. This is an editor test.\"</p> <p>Then press OK.</p> <p>Now go to \"Edit Briefing\", and type in the sentence. \"Investigate and Engage incoming air contacts.\" Press OK. Most scenarios need and have a longer briefing, but this works for now.</p> <p>Save the scenario again and return to the title screen.</p> <p>At the title screen, go to \"start new game\", and select the scenario in question. The scenario will appear as having Mauritania as the location, a higher complexity and difficulty score, and the scenario description of \"Defend southern Mauritania from unknown red contacts. This is an editor test.\"</p> <p>The only option is to play as Blue, and you will see the Blue \"Investigate and Engage incoming air contacts\" briefing. Enter the scenario and run it for a bit. Two air contacts should appear, detected by the Bar Lock.</p> <p>Using either an intercept mission, patrol mission, or manual engagement, send the Phantoms up to engage the contacts. They will be shot down. Once one C-130 is downed, if all has gone right, a popup saying \"The scenario has concluded. You will now be presented with the evaluation of your performance.\" will appear. Press OK. Another window should appear, saying Triumph: Final Score 500\" (or 1000 if both planes were quickly downed). You've won!</p> <p>A complete scenario has now been made and played.</p>"},{"location":"scenedit/#53-lua","title":"5.3 Lua","text":""},{"location":"scenedit/#531-lua-scripting","title":"5.3.1 Lua Scripting","text":"<p>Lua is a programming language that Command uses for advanced scripting. It is extremely versatile and can provide many bonuses. Even at their simplest, Lua scripts can add much versatility beyond the limits of what the internal event editor alone can provide.</p> <p>The Basics:</p> <p>Lua can be used to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Spawn, as opposed to teleport, units into the map during a scenario.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change the weather mid-scenario.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reassign units to different missions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change side postures and doctrine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add elements of chance so that the scenario is never the same way   twice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make scenarios detailed and varied.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Thus, Lua can be used for creating a basic scenario where the player starts with a random variety of units. It is here that a basic walkthrough will be conducted.</p> <p>In either a subset of \"event actions\" or a \"Lua script console\" in the event editor, there's a Lua menu. A basic set of \"recipes\" are there, see \"Command Lua API\" at https://commandlua.github.io/ for explanations. One such recipe is ScenEdit_AddUnit (Table). When filled in, it looks like this:</p> <p>ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR', name='B-23',   dbid='187', latitude='49.3812997111192',   longitude='-36.8903957715054'})</p> <p>This, if run with a side marked \"USSR\" in a DB3K database, will generate a Foxtrot-class submarine named B-23 in the middle of the North Atlantic.</p> <p>NOTE: Lua can be very finicky, and a single character in the wrong spot can mess up a script. Also, be aware that values carry over across scenarios, so do not assume they will be the default ones.</p> <p>That example is using Lua to duplicate something that can be accomplished with the traditional interface. The same task could be accomplished via finding the spot in the Atlantic and using the unit editor. A more complex task is to include one of three very different submarines.</p> <p>a = math.random(1,3)   if a == 1 then   ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='B-10',   dbid='287', latitude='50.52351341355',   longitude='-37.177899984719'})   elseif a == 2 then   ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='B-15',   dbid='278', latitude='50.52351341355',   longitude='-37.177899984719'})   elseif a == 3 then   ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='K-115',   dbid='391', latitude='50.52351341355',   longitude='-37.177899984719'})   end</p> <p>Here there is an even chance of one of the following three submarines being spawned.</p> <p>B-10, a Whiskey (one of the earliest and least capable diesel subs)</p> <p>B-15, a Juliett (a 1960s diesel submarine that still has long-range anti-ship missiles)</p> <p>K-115, a Charlie II (a nuclear submarine with advanced Bazalt/Sandbox-style anti-ship missiles)</p> <p>Tying this script to an event that is triggered after the scenario is loaded (see 5.5 Events on page 93) is the next step. Once a player (with the \"USSR\" being a playable side) runs the scenario in non-ScenEdit mode long enough to trigger the event, they will receive one of the three submarines.</p> <p>For a non-playable side, patrol orders need to be bundled-in for any mobile unit. For example:</p> <p>ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='B-24',   dbid='287', latitude='51.52351341355',   longitude='-38.177899984719'})   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('B-24', 'eastpatrol')</p> <p>Creating two different (and possibly) empty missions in the scenario editor, having the USSR be a non-playable side, and using a math.random script as follows:</p> <p>a = math.random(1,2)   if a == 1 then   ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='B-24',   dbid='287', latitude='51.52351341355',   longitude='-38.177899984719'})   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('B-24', 'eastpatrol')   elseif a == 2 then   ScenEdit_AddUnit({type='Sub', side='USSR',name='B-24',   dbid='287', latitude='51.52351341355',   longitude='-38.177899984719'})   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('B-24', 'westpatrol')   end</p> <p>..means that once the event is triggered, a Whiskey submarine will spawn in the same spot and conduct a mission in one of two areas. This sort of Lua randomization is useful for increasing the variability and replayability of scenarios.</p> <p>Lua can do more than just set up scenarios. It can also make them more dynamic.</p> <p>One Lua action is using the previously mentioned ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission to either assign or change missions for units that already exist. Simple random selection can make the following units assigned to one of three possibilities.</p> <p>a = math.random(1,10)   if a\\&lt;5 then   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #1', 'NONE')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #2', 'NONE')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #3', 'NONE')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #4', 'NONE')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #5', 'NONE')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #6', 'NONE')   elseif a&gt;=5 and a\\&lt;8 then   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #1', 'Close   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #2', 'Close   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #3', 'Close   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #4', 'Close   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #5', 'Close   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #6', 'Close   Patrol')   elseif a&gt;=8 then   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #1', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #2', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #3', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #4', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #5', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   ScenEdit_AssignUnitToMission('Ukrainian Flanker #6', 'Aggressive   Patrol')   end</p> <p>Depending on the roll, the six Su-27s will either stay grounded (NONE-assigned to no mission), launch but only stay near their air bases (assigned to the \"Close Patrol\" mission), or launch in a mission with a large prosecution area, making them more eager to fight (assigned to the \"Aggressive Patrol\" mission).</p> <p>Another is changing sensor statuses to active or passive via ScenEdit_SetEMCON. The template is as follows:</p> <p>ScenEdit_SetEMCON('EMCONSubjectType', 'EMCONSubjectNameOrID',   'EMCONSettings')</p> <p>SubjectType can be a unit, group, mission, or side.</p> <p>For a single unit it could be:</p> <p>ScenEdit_SetEMCON('Unit', 'USS McCracken', 'Radar=Passive')</p> <p>This turns off the radars on a unit called the USS McCracken.</p> <p>Whereas for an entire side it could be:</p> <p>ScenEdit_SetEMCON('Side', 'USSR', 'Sonar=Active;Radar=Passive')</p> <p>This turns off the radars but turns on the active sonars for every \"USSR\" unit.</p> <p>This can be combined with triggers (see 5.5.3 Triggers on page 97) to enhance scenarios in the following ways:</p> <p>-Combined with time-related triggers to symbolize intermittent emissions. A unit doesn't have to go to the extremes of either always or never using the active sensors.</p> <p>-Combined with detection-related triggers to symbolize a unit commander going \"Ok, the cat's out of the bag, better emit for the sake of awareness\" without needing to be explicitly under attack.</p> <p>-Combined with special actions to symbolize a general order, particularly if it's on an allied side the player otherwise doesn't directly control.</p> <p>Still another Lua capability is changing the weather. The ScenEdit_SetWeather function has four inputs: temperature (increments of 0 to 50 degrees Celsius), rainfall (increments of 0 to 50), clouds (increments of 0.1 to 1), and sea state (increments of 0 to 9).</p> <p>So, in basic terms, running the following SetWeather action-</p> <p>ScenEdit_SetWeather((35),(12),(0.6),(4))</p> <p>...will lead to a base temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), moderate high clouds and rain, and a sea state of 4 (wind 11-16 knots, small waves).</p> <p>Lua is capable of much more than these major examples. It can even create a type of \"AI\" if the programmer is skilled enough.</p> <p>If in doubt about anything, or if one simply wants to learn more, ask online in the \"Lua Legion\" subforum at http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tt.asp?forumid=1681.</p>"},{"location":"scenedit/#54-editor-drop-down-menu","title":"5.4 Editor Drop-Down Menu","text":"<p>The editor drop-down menu only appears in ScenEdit mode and contains the scenario creation functions.</p>"},{"location":"scenedit/#541-scenario-times-duration","title":"5.4.1 Scenario Times + Duration","text":"<p>This drop down allows you to set the current scenario time, the scenario start time, scenario duration, complexity, difficulty and location.

Proficiency can swing marginal fights one way or another but is (generally) less important when one side or unit has a clear supremacy. Often, putting assets in the right place at the right time is more important than the exact performance of those assets.</p> <p>Side Enablers:</p> <p>Modern warfare is not \"WW2 but with better weapons\", and the comforts of post-Cold War COIN &amp; intervention / regime-change ops are no longer to be taken for granted. The GPS navigation systems guiding modern platforms and weapons will likely be disrupted\u00a0(in fact count yourself lucky if the satellite constellation above you survives), and the\u00a0BLOS comms\u00a0that forces rely upon for everything from cell-phone connectivity to\u00a0drone control\u00a0may or may not be available, theater-wide or locally.</p> <p>Side Enabler Function</p> <p>A key side-related feature of Command is the concept and framework of \"Side Enablers\"\u00a0(aka \"theater access options\"): Capabilities that act as force multipliers, enabling options for action -- or taking them off the table if they become unavailable.</p> <p>The most common enabler is access to satellite-based navigation, particularly with regards to weapon guidance (and more recently, autonomous operation of drones). GPS is of course the most commonly referred example, but GLONASS (Russia), BeiDou (China) and NavIC (India) are also other options.</p> <p>These enablers are available for configuration in Command when editing the properties of Sides in the Scenario Editor:</p> <p></p> <p>Clicking the \"Enablers\" button brings up the available enablers for the selected side:</p> <p></p> <p>Checking or unchecking each checkbox enables or disables this capability for the selected side.</p> <p>Apart from the top Side-level, these enabler items are also configurable on a local basis. The idea here is that in many cases the ability (or lack thereof) to use a certain functionality may be restricted geographically; Starlink's \"no Ukraine\" geofencing for its LEO-BLOS comms service is a recent example, but another common case may be the localized jamming/spoofing of GPS on a town or frontline of interest. The reverse may also be true: A given service may be generally unavailable theater-wide but available on a specific area (local beacons for both PNT/GNSS and comms are rapidly proliferating; you can now fit some of them even on artillery shells).</p> <p>The way we model area-specific availability is through the area &amp; reference-points manager:</p> <p></p> <p>By selecting a zone and clicking on the new \"Enablers\" button, we get access to the same menu of enabler options as on the side level. Embedding this ability on zones also allows taking advantage of all the nice properties already present in them, such as anchoring them on units, contacts or reference points.</p> <p>Given that the (non)availability of these services can be highly dependent on events happening during the sim execution (or player decisions), it makes sense that the enablers themselves are configurable also through Lua scripting. Here is an example of fetching the enablers for a given zone and modifying them:</p> <p>local s = VP_GetSide({name='side-A'}) print(s) local z = s.standardzones local myz = s:getstandardzone(z[1].guid) print(myz.enablers) myz.enablers = {GNSS_GLONASS = true, GNSS_GPS = false} print(myz.enablers)</p> <p>GNSS disruption implementation in Command</p> <p>The first concrete implementation of the enabler's framework is, to no-one's surprise, GNSS disruption. This is a large topic of discussion in western defence circles as an acknowledged vulnerability, given that so many different weapon systems since Desert Storm have come to rely on GPS navigation for guidance -- and this trend has been also subsequently replicated in Russia, China &amp; India\u00a0(to our knowledge, the pan-European Galileo system has not yet been adopted as a guidance component on any fielded weapon system).</p> <p>GNSS disruption (in the form or jamming, spoofing or complete denial of service) is a huge and highly technical subject, but in the context of terminal weapons guidance its effects are fairly simple: It significantly increases the CEP figure of anti-surface weapons, thus significantly degrading their accuracy. Such weapons typically rely on an internal inertial navigation system (INS) which acts as the primary navigation reference, with the GNSS providing a regular correction to the INS's inevitable drift. If GNSS is denied, the weapon has to rely entirely on its INS for terminal guidance.</p> <p>When a weapon is denied a GNSS update, a \"NOGNSS\" warning is shown next to the weapon icon on the map, to indicate that this weapon is suffering from such degradation:</p> <p></p> <p>When the weapon's impact is evaluated, the INS drift due to GNSS denial is taken into account and may significantly raise the final CEP value used in the impact evaluation. This is presented in the message log, as in this example:</p> <p>&gt; 8/4/2017 10:08:14 -- Weapon: GBU-39/B SDB #993 has been without a GNSS update for 6 min 49 sec. Weapon has INS: 1990s+ tactical weapon INS. Max drift: 105m. Actual drift (CEP increase): 79m</p> <p>Notice in this example the significant difference between max and actual drift: The max drift represents the maximum deviation from the DMPI if one assumes that all drift perturbations will cumulatively swing the weapon away from the aimpoint. A more (statistically) likely case is that the actual deviation will be somewhere between zero and max; in this case 79 meters.</p> <p>There is a popular misconception on public discourse, that GNSS disruption can instantly turn a weapon useless. This is a gross exaggeration. The actual effect of such degradation on a weapon's impact accuracy, and to its overall effectiveness, will strongly depend on the inherent accuracy of the weapon's INS system, the time the weapon spends in a degraded state (INS drifts with time, not distance covered), the weapon's warhead type and yield, as well as the type and physical dimensions of the aimed target.</p> <p>Some recent examples illustrating this:</p> <ul> <li> <p>According to persistent reports,\u00a0ground-launched SDB (GLSDB) bombs   have been ineffective in the Ukraine theater due to extensive GPS   jamming/spoofing.   This makes sense for a weapon like SDB, whose penetrator-explosive   warhead is highly dependent on high accuracy (a near-miss does not   produce any proximity damage; it's direct-hit or bust); combined with   an increased flight time (i.e. more time to be exposed to GNSS   disruption, depending on the reach of enemy EM activity) this creates   ample opportunity to disrupt the weapon sufficiently to make it a   clean miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the same theater, GMLRS guided rockets have reportedly been highly   successful despite facing the very same jamming activity against them.   Why? The warheads of these rockets are area weapons (they disperse   bomblets) so a near miss usually is as good as a spot-on direct hit.   Additionally, their small flight time reduces the opportunity for   significant jamming and thus diversion.\u00a0(Reportedly air-launched   SDBs, the very same type as ground-launched by GLSDB,\u00a0have also been   a popular   weapon.   Why? Presumably the shorter flight time compared to the   ground-launched variant makes for a sharply reduced window of   GNSS-jamming vulnerability.)</p> </li> <li> <p>High-velocity weapons in general have an inherent advantage in such   conditions because of the time-based drift on INS systems. This is an   additional reason that high-speed systems (incl. hypersonics) are a   popular avenue for research and development.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note #1:\u00a0The current GNSS disruption model applies only to weapons that use INS+GNSS for terminal guidance (JDAM being the prime example), and NOT to weapons that combine INS+GNSS for mid-course guidance with homing sensors for terminal guidance (e.g. most modern cruise missiles). There are a number of reasons for this, incl. the complexity of representing \"actual\" vs \"perceived\" weapon position\u00a0(cue the \"missile knows where it is\" memes...),\u00a0as well as the fact that such systems use terminal homing precisely in order to compensate for mid-course guidance errors and thus are less susceptible to GNSS disruption.</p> <p>Note #2:\u00a0Currently there is no distinct field in the database to mark the INS performance level of each individual weapon. For this reason, a simple \"deduction\" algorithm is used, based on the weapon properties:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the weapon is a guided gun round (e.g. Excalibur) or rocket (e.g.   GMLRS), assume it uses MEMS-based INS (Assumed drift: 5nm / hr.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise, if the weapon's maximum range is under 162NM, assume it   uses a \"1990s+ tactical weapon\"-grade INS (Assumed drift: 0.5 nm /   hr.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Otherwise for longer-range weapons, assume it uses a \"1990s+   high-grade\" INS (AIRS etc.) (Assumed drift: 0.05 nm / hr.)</p> </li> </ul> <p>The 162NM (300km) threshold is based on the MCTR regime rules, which treat missile weapons with a &gt;300km range as \"strategic\".</p> <p>Switch To: This drop-down allows you to switch the view perspective in the editor to each side you have created.</p>"},{"location":"scenedit/#545-edit-briefing","title":"5.4.5 Edit Briefing","text":"<p>This function calls the edit briefing dialog which allows players to add text, pictures and links to the side briefings that appear for each side in the load scenario dialog and briefings dialog.

Something like 1,000 points for hitting the target, -100 points for losing an aircraft, and 750 points being the line between minor victory and average allows for a bit of slack.

People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.\" - Intro to \"Match Point\" by Woody Allen</p> <p>There is a question that is being frequently asked about Command: Is the execution deterministic? Is it random? If the latter, can it be configured to run in a deterministic mode instead?</p> <p>Deterministic and stochastic models are approaches in various fields, including machine learning, simulation and decision support. Understanding the differences between these models is crucial for making informed decisions and analysis.</p> <p>Deterministic models are based on precise inputs and produce the same output for a given set of inputs. These models assume that the future can be predicted with certainty based on the current state. Chess is a classic example of a fully-deterministic complex system.</p> <p>On the other hand, stochastic models incorporate randomness and uncertainty into the modeling process. They consider the probability of different outcomes and provide various possible results.</p> <p>Deterministic models assume that all variables are known and can be accurately measured. They rely on precise inputs and produce deterministic outputs. Stochastic models, on the other hand, consider uncertainty and randomness. They incorporate probabilistic inputs and have a range of possible outputs, allowing decision-makers to assess the likelihood of different outcomes.</p> <p>A fully-deterministic simulation certainly has its uses. For example, when performing a small-scale test (e.g. a single missile attacks a single aircraft), it is desirable to set all variables of non-interest to fixed, static values so that the variable of interest (e.g. the successful seduction rate of a decoy against the threat missile) can be tweaked, and the result of the change evaluated.</p> <p>COMMAND can indeed be configured to provide a small-scale \"controlled environment\" such as this: The weapon impact mechanics and other sim-events (sensor detections, AI decisions etc.) can be extended and/or overridden through a number of ways, in order to provide a control baseline for the experiment or analysis at hand.</p> <p>Where full determinism begins to run into issues of real-life relevance is as the simulation scale increases, from the small-scale, low-level technical/engineering to the tactical and operational levels - i.e. where COMMAND really shines. Any complex system, and particularly one with human involvement, is virtually guaranteed to display variance in the execution of events, in the combination order of these events and even in the individual probability of any single of these events happening. Tom Chivers, an author on science issues, recently wrote an excellent article about the human uneasiness with navigating this \"sea of uncertainty\": https://unherd.com/2021/07/what-warhammer-taught-me-about-life/</p> <p>Even low-level technical/engineering events, nominally the playground of full-determinism, can in fact suffer from uncertainty. As an example, on June 18, 2017, a USN F/A-18E operating over Syria engaged a SyAAF Su-22M4 tail-on with an AIM-9X missile. The missile was successfully decoyed by flares. A strict engineering analysis would have shown this to be practically impossible; the AIM-9X was expressly designed to reject these very old, primitive Soviet-era flares. In reality, the Syrian pilot was just very lucky that day (for a short while; he was subsequently shot down by an AMRAAM missile fired by that same USN aircraft). In a fully-deterministic simulation this outcome either never happens at all, or always invariably happens. In a stochastic simulation, what happened was very unlikely, but feasible.</p> <p>Command is expressly designed to reflect this \"sea of uncertainty\" in its modeling of real-world military operations - while concurrently respecting the mostly immutable nature of the physics foundations its simulation engine rests on. Historical accounts of real-life operations are full of \"dirty\" details like \"...and number #4 in the flight had to divert to the nearest airfield because he had maneuvered off the group to avoid a SAM, this took him right over an unsuspected AAA site which punctured his fuel tank and he was leaking fuel like a sieve\". A fully-deterministic simulation has little room for such \"imperfections\" of both man and machine; whereas they are constant occurrences in Command.</p> <p>Command achieves this effect by combining multiple execution paradigms within its sim engine: Aspects such as physics (e.g. movement, weather etc.), sensor detections, fuel consumption, cargo transfer, crew proficiency, mission tasking, doctrine &amp; rules of engagement (ROE), and basic crew AI decision trees are addressed in a deterministic fashion. (Hardcore physicists may argue that even the physics fundamentals contain built-in variance and entropy and thus laugh at absolute predictions, but this is an abstraction the dev team can live with). Other aspects, such as weapon impact, damage inflicted and subsequent damage control are more fuzzy and handled stochastically: There is a \"control\" baseline, but things can go either way to an extent. Finally, the structure of the sim engine itself (multi-actor simulation with multithreaded execution, each actor running his \"story\" within the sim timeslice in parallel to others) creates built-in race conditions and thus a chaotic environment of interaction - just like real-life.</p> <p>In addition, Command has the ability to record the simulation execution and afterwards go back into any of the saved snapshots and resume execution from that point. This provides an additional way of ensuring a consistent state up to a certain point in the timeline before spawning off to a new what-if branch.</p>"},{"location":"simulation/#122-general-sim-engine-flow-what-happens-on-each-pulse","title":"12.2 General sim-engine flow: What happens on each pulse","text":"<p>Command's simulation loop can be set to run at three different timeslice settings; 0.1-sec pulse (aka \"fine-grained\"), 1-sec pulse (aka \"coarse\" or \"flame\") or 5-sec pulse (aka \"very coarse\" or \"double-flame\")</p> <p>When using 1-1 (real-time), 2x, 5x and 15x acceleration, the fine-grained setting is used. In \"flame\" acceleration the coarse setting is used. In double-flame acceleration the 5-sec setting is used.</p> <p>Other sim designs choose to use even larger slice values for their coarse setting (e.g. 15-sec pulse) in order to boost performance, but in a detailed tactical simulation this can create problems (e.g. a missile is ahead of a target on pulse X, then afterwards well beyond a target on pulse X+1, and the impact that should happen is never evaluated). So, 5-sec pulses are as coarse as we'll go, and we gain good performance by other measures.</p> <p>Most of the non-kinematic operations in a simulation pipeline, for example most AI calculations, happen at 1-sec (or more) intervals. So, it does not make a difference if the sim runs at hi-fi or coarse setting, as e.g. a targeting evaluation may happen every 4 seconds in both cases. What will change is that the trajectory of e.g. a turn curve will be smoother in hi-fi mode.</p> <p>On the other hand, weapon impacts and other time-critical events are evaluated on each pulse, so there will be a slight difference in precise timestamp between the two modes (e.g. a weapon impact may register at 07:46:02.300 at hi-fi mode (3 tenths of the next second), but at 07:46:03 in coarse mode (as all events are checked on a second-by-second basis, so all times are rounded-up to the next second).</p> <p>Command uses a combination of deterministic models (e.g. for movement, intra-base air/boat operations, effects of weather, sensor checks etc.) and stochastic elements (weapon impact &amp; damage evaluation, order of AI calculations between multiple units etc.). So indeed, the engagement results are not perfectly reproducible at the microscopic level, but in a repeated series of running the same scenario the probabilistic trends gradually manifest themselves. For example, in an engagement between a Eurofighter and a MiG-23, all other things equal/neutral, the MiG may well get some lucky breaks here and there (Remember the Libyan Su-22 that successfully evaded/decoyed an AIM-9X shot? A strictly deterministic simulation would barf at things like that), but statistically the EF should dominate.</p>"},{"location":"simulation/#123-terrain-modeling-aka-land-cover","title":"12.3 Terrain Modeling (aka Land Cover)","text":"<p>Terrain type is a decisive factor in any land-related operations (including air-to-ground actions or land-impacting artillery delivered from the sea).

If no direct hit is achieved on any facility, the weapon impacts the ground (or airbursts if applicable) and, if it has an explosive warhead, detonates; proximity damage is then applied to everyone within applicable range, depending on the warhead type &amp; yield.</p> <p>Anti-aerospace engagements are different, as no CEP is involved. The weapon's nominal Pk value represents its ability to hit a large, cooperative target (think \"B-52 or B-747 flying straight and level\") on a perfect day. Since most aerospace targets are usually not that cooperative or easy to spot, various modifiers are sequentially applied on this nominal value: Small size of the target, the target's agility if it is actively maneuvering to avoid the weapon, pilot skill etc. This can easily lead to a wide gap between the weapon's nominal Pk and the eventual actual Pk that is used to evaluate the probability of hit.</p> <p>Following is a typical example of an AAW missile engagement endgame, as shown on the message log.

These figures are adjusted to provide for a number of modifiers; for example, many modern warheads employ significantly more potent explosives than TNT, such as PBXN-109. While the DP is a convenient reference number for comparisons etc., nonetheless each warhead type produces different effects and has different effectiveness depending on target type. As a general rule, warheads that produce blast (e.g. high-explosives like aerial bombs) are most effective against soft targets (light-armored vehicles, personnel, unhardened buildings etc.) and they can also be quite effective even with near-misses. Warheads that rely on direct impact (e.g. armor-piercing shells, penetrator bombs or laser weapons) are generally ineffective if they miss even slightly but can be very effective against armored targets.</p> <p>Moreover, the amount of damage inflicted on a unit will depend on the extent that the warhead has managed to penetrate the unit's armor. An anti-ship missile with a semi armor-piercing warhead may have the same nominal destructive power as a general purpose bomb, but is able to cause significantly more damage to a ship because it will lodge itself inside it before detonating, whereas the bomb will go off immediately upon contact. Even \"pure\", non-explosive penetrators have significant destructive potential both because of their kinetic energy (Command takes this into account as well), and also because most units are more vulnerable to internal than external damage.</p> <p>The ability of a weapons/warhead to penetrate armor depends on its built-in characteristics (armor-piercing shells and bombs are particularly optimized for this), relative speed at the time of impact, and the armor rating of the target.</p> <p>All platforms comprise of discrete components that perform various combat related functions. These components may be weapon mounts (guns, missile launchers, decoy launchers etc.), sensors, aircraft or ship facilities, powerplant sections, command decks etc. When a unit is hit by a weapon, apart from absorbing damage on its own, each of these components may also be damaged or destroyed. Because the components of a platform are often inter-dependent in their function, seemingly subtle damage can frequently have severe operational effects; for example knocking out the sole SARH illuminator of a ship may render that ship completely unable to operate its SAMs, or damage to an aircraft carrier's elevators (even only some of them) immediately bottlenecks the practical aircraft sortie rates.</p> <p>Depending on the weapon/warhead that impacts, the damage inflicted on a unit may vary on its intensity or focus. For example, a fragmentation bomb will generally do little damage to a ship's hull, but the high-speed fragments can easily damage many exposed sensors or weapon mounts. A ship being repeatedly hit by such bombs (or gun shells set to airburst etc.) may easily end up being completely knocked out of action, with all its weapons and sensors inoperative, even though it is still structurally intact. On the other hand, a heavy internal detonation (such as one produced by an armor-piercing bomb or missile warhead) can completely obliterate a bunker even without damaging any of its components. Underwater detonations (torpedoes, mines etc.) apart from their raw shock damage have the added element of the explosive gas bubble that, if the geometry is right, can cause severe structural damage (break the back of the ship).</p> <p>As a very simple example: An AS-13 missile impacts an Adelaide-class (Australian OH Perry) frigate. The kinetic damage alone is 17 DPs (so even if the warhead is a dud, the missile will do at least that much \"shock\" damage). The missile penetrates the frigate's hull 100% (no serious armor) and detonates inside, which doubles the warhead's nominal DP potential (250 x2 = 500 DP). The tremendous explosion destroys 4 weapon mounts, 3 sensors and the helicopter hangar, and damages 2 more mounts, 3 sensors and the bridge. The ship has suffered grave damage and may be out of the fight depending on which systems were knocked out. If the ship has less than 520 DPs available, she may be lost outright.</p> <p>Weapon impacts can also cause secondary damage such as fire or flooding. This again steadily eats away at a unit's DP value (representing overall structural damage) and further damages or destroys individual components. The type of secondary damage depends largely on the warhead type (e.g. underwater detonations are more likely to cause flooding, whereas fragmentation or incendiary explosions are a great way to start fires). The platform's virtual crew will continuously try to first contain and then eliminate secondary damage through damage-control efforts; this may succeed or fail on a number of factors, chief among them crew proficiency. It is not uncommon in a low proficiency-crewed boat for fires or flooding to get out of control and result in disintegration, magazine explosion or capsizing (or simply structural collapse).</p> <p>The discrete aimpoints in an aimpoint-style facility (e.g. vehicle group) very in their vulnerability to different warhead effects. For example, tanks are a lot harder to kill with proximity blast, while e.g. trucks are much easier. Bomblets are very likely to start fires if they impact (lots of small explosions). For the same reason they are more likely to cause component hits even if they barely scratch the target structurally.</p>"},{"location":"simulation/#127-comms-disruption-cyber-attacks","title":"12.7 Comms Disruption &amp; Cyber Attacks","text":"<p>Most wargames and simulations accustom their users to the idea of omnipresent, instant, always-on communications. The battle may be lost -- your forces &amp; assets may be in disarray -- but you are always in control of them and aware of their whereabouts, activities and condition. You are always in the know and in power. The pawns in the chessboard are always at your disposal.</p> <p>But what happens when the lights go out? When the only sound on the radio is static? When the datalink is dead?</p> <p>This is fast becoming an ever-important question, both because the western armed forces are increasing their reliance on distributed, hyper-connected force concepts (the F-35 and the US Navy's NIFC-CA being fine examples) and because potential peer competitors, fully aware of this trend, are rapidly improving their electronic attack and cyber-warfare capabilities. The ever-evolving chess game of electronic warfare has never been limited to the radar bands, but more recently communications and datalinks are becoming increasingly appealing targets.</p> <p>Command handles this aspect of operations explicitly. We want to show players both the \"how\" and the \"why\" of communication lines breaking, and the practical effects of units being isolated from their parent side's common picture. A unit that is out of comms will have a small set of text reading NOCOMM next to it to indicate its situation.</p> <p></p> <p>Causes...</p> <p>In order to enable this feature, the scenario author must ensure that under \"Scenario Features and Settings\", the \"Communications Disruption\" box is checked.</p> <p>A unit can have its communications disrupted in a number of ways:</p> <p>If all its onboard comm devices and datalinks become non-operational (damaged or destroyed):</p> <p>This frigate is about to become very lonely</p> <p>Through the Lua scripting API: As an example: ScenEdit_SetUnit({Name=\"USS Vigilant\", OutOfComms=\"True\"}). This is a very versatile technique as it can be used to model any number of factors, both man-made and natural, that can cause a unit to go \"off-grid\":</p> <p>A submarine hooking up to HF or satellite communications when it goes to periscope depth, and breaking contact again when it submerges.</p> <p>A satellite linking only temporarily with its ground station to dump its intelligence product and receive new tasking instructions, then again going in isolation in space (contrary to popular fiction, even modern intelligence satellites are rarely, if ever, in constant link with their ground control stations).</p> <p>A cyber-attack directed at the internal comms infrastructure of the targeted platform. (Your comm devices may be physically untouched, but the server at the core of the comms exchange just got taken over. Tough world!)</p> <p>Physical incapacitation (damage/destruction) of a critical C3I node leading to other unit's dependent on it going offline (remember that many of the first-night targets in Desert Storm were headquarters, C3 bunkers and comm buildings? You can recreate why this was a critical action).</p> <p>Through the scenario editor GUI, by selecting the unit and marking it as \"out of comms\".</p> <p>This is less powerful than using the Lua API but a simpler and faster way for quick setups. So, for example, you may use this to configure a unit to be \"off grid\" at the start of a scenario, and follow-up with a Lua script depending on some later action that changes this unit's connectivity.</p> <p>By jamming its comm devices, using communications jamming equipment similar to existing OECM systems. [NOTE: Integrated comms-jamming is a feature reserved for the Professional Edition. However, with a bit of creative work you can use the Lua API to approximate this in the commercial version of Command.]</p> <p>...and Effects</p> <p>So, what are the results of a unit going \"off-grid\"?</p> <p>The most obvious effect is that the unit is no longer under your positive control. You no longer know where it is currently located (you only know where it was when it last checked-in, and if any of your other still-connected assets manages to make contact with it, this \"last datum\" is updated). You don't know what it is doing, what its fuel, weapons or damage status is. You don't know if it is peacefully loitering with not a care in the world or if it is fighting for its life. You will know its fate with certainty only when it comes back to its base -- or is destroyed first.</p> <p>\"Last we heard from Garry he was somewhere there... and that's all we know.\"</p> <p>For its part, the cut-off unit loses all the benefits of the common side-wide operational picture; its situational awareness now reaches out just to the limit of its own sensors and no further. It has no idea what is going on \"out there\". It can still detect, investigate and prosecute contacts on its own and proceed with its assigned mission if it has one, but all the benefits of mutual support are gone. Cooperatively patrolling a large area to split up areas? Nope. Efficient fire coordination? (\"You shoot bandit #1 and I'll take #2\") Forget about it. Even worse, it now has to be really careful with anything that shows up on the scope. Is that new contact a friendly or an enemy? You'd better hope its RoE and doctrine settings take such a situation into account -- or prepare for blue-on-blues!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Garry is now alone and trying to adjust to the sudden loss of SA from the nearby AWACS. Notice the only contact still \"fresh\" is the one that the F-15 is actually detecting on its own; the other contacts, hitherto provided by the E-3, are now deteriorating fast.</p> <p>Units that lose their comms connectivity retain local copies of the contacts that were available to them before they went offline; essentially, they inherit a snapshot of their parent side's theater picture at the moment of their breakaway. However, without the benefit of information exchange with their parent network, this snapshot immediately starts to lose its currency and most of the contacts will soon vanish unless refreshed by the unit's own sensors. (It's like walking down a busy street, taking a last look around and closing your eyes. The longer you remain blind, the less relevant &amp; useful your last memory will become.)</p> <p>Units that manage to get through their \"isolation\" and re-join their side comms network share their contact information. You can use this to model things like film-return satellites (the Russians still use them!), a submarine sharing its intelligence take after rejoining its battlegroup etc. If the parent side already has these contacts, the updated information (including BDA -- very handy!) is merged and used to refine the contact information.</p> <p>As mentioned, the player has no control over his \"disconnected\" units. However, playing out a scenario in ScenEdit mode (which is essentially \"cheating\" but also very useful for analysis) affords an additional ability: To literally jump into the cockpit/CIC of the isolated unit and experience its \"loneliness\" first-hand (Editor --&gt; Isolated POV view). This is an excellent way to understand how a comms-isolated unit perceives its environment and reacts to it (which is usually quite different from when it operates as part of an integrated network). Quickly switching between \"side-wide common picture\" and \"isolated POV view\" can be a real eye-opener as to the value of a well-connected battle force and the hazards and challenges of \"comms off\". It is simple enough to say \"we'll not transmit so the bad guys cannot sniff us out\". But how well can you really fight in the dark?</p> <p>Living with vulnerable comms</p> <p>Players using this feature will probably have to adjust to a different mindset as well as absorb the new options it affords them. A few random thoughts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Non-kinetic options are now significantly more expanded. Forget   jamming radars; now you can do some real sneaky tricks. It is   remarkable how much more brittle and inefficient, say, an IADS becomes   when you can selectively take any of its critical nodes offline.   (Michael Scofield would love to be able to brick the guards' phones   during his break-out/break-in escapades). Put another way: Going   ultra-stealth or swarming cruise missiles over every radar &amp; SAM site   are no longer your only, or even your best options.</p> </li> <li> <p>An initial tempting thought was to freely use comms disruption as a   standard built-in feature to all existing scenarios. It was soon   discovered, in hilarious ways, how this can wreck scenarios that were   not designed with this factor in mind. As an example, in the   standalone scenario \"Duelists\", we \"flipped the switch\" on the Soviet   surface group just to see what would happen. Because the group had a   standing \"forbidden zone\" around it that automatically marked   violators as hostile, and in combination with very liberal \"shoot   first\" ROEs, the ships in the group almost immediately proceeded to   blow each other out of the water with righteous fury, with even a   distant Oscar-class sub joining the action with its beastly antiship   missiles. It really was blue-on-blue in its most pure, raw form.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apart from the obvious step of making this new feature optional so   that existing scenarios can function as before, we also added a lot of   \"reasonable smarts\" to the AI crews so that events like the above   Soviet shootout were less likely to happen. So for example, when   detecting a new contact close to where a friendly off-grid unit was   last known/reported, the side-wide AI is now a bit more careful even   if the new contact is a violator of a forbidden zone (\"easy on the   trigger, guys... maybe it's Garry after all\"). Likewise, cut-off units   compare their new contacts with the most recent datum of their known   comrades and will ignore contacts that seem to be right on top of   where their buddies were when they last heard from them. After putting   together such refinements and re-trying the Duelists test, the   isolated Soviet units were now significantly more restrained on how   they prosecuted sudden new contacts after their breakaway.</p> </li> </ul> <p>(On the flip side, if you are the one creating the chaos, this   creates excellent \"false flag\" opportunities for exploiting it. For   example, if you can swiftly and unobserved dispatch comms-isolated   units that are part of an enemy distributed force, the longer you can   remain in their general location the longer it may take for their   friends to get suspicious of you. Cloak and dagger fans rejoice!)</p> <ul> <li>Comms vulnerability really drives home the dirty little secret of most   network-based CONOPS. People talk about swarms, distributed lethality   and all the rest of current jargon -- but all of this assumes reliable   communications.   This also reinforces the importance of sufficient individual   capability: A modern warship, even when comms-isolated, is still a   powerful unit. It has a fair chance of accomplishing its mission even   without the obvious benefits of cooperation with its consorts. On the   other hand, a \"swarm\" unit (be it a small speedboat, a drone etc.)   that relies on the \"my strength is in the pack\" principle? Take comms   off and its power drops precipitously (it is not an accident that   comms-jammers are rather more favored for counter-drone defence than   hard-kill measures).</li> </ul> <p>Some other scenario-editing ideas for taking advantage of this feature:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Special actions, with units on the opposing side getting their comms   knocked out. This is used to simulate a computer network attack, but   could also represent saboteurs physically disrupting the comms   network.</p> </li> <li> <p>A \"unit enters area\" trigger where a friendly unit representing a   jammer (i.e. an EA-6B Prowler or similar) arrives on station. The   script is fired, and representing its jamming capabilities, units on   the opposing side have their comms taken out.</p> </li> <li> <p>A \"unit enters area\" trigger where run-off the mill friendly units get   their comms knocked out, forcing them to continue prearranged missions   or move aimlessly in circles until they run low on fuel and return to   base. This, especially in earlier-period scenarios, simulates units   outrunning their lines of communication. It can also be used to   simulate submarine operations.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"simulation/#128-drone-autonomy-levels","title":"12.8 Drone Autonomy Levels","text":"<p>Introduced in Command Modern Operations V1.08 - 4^th^ July 2025.</p> <p>Information below is from: https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5886</p> <p>\"True drone autonomy isn't just about flying without a pilot---it's about making real-time decisions in unpredictable environments, with limited data, constrained power, and no room for error\"</p> <p>-- ChatGPT, reflecting on its siblings on the front line</p> <p>Uncrewed combat &amp; support platforms (aka \"drones\") are all the rage these days in defence circles, and not without good reason. However, they suffer from a fundamental limitation compared to more \"traditional\" crewed platforms: When not under direct human control (ie. in a realistically comms-challenged environment in any non-lopsided conflict), their ability to autonomously carry out their intended mission is drastically curtailed. By how much? Well, contrary to men, not all drones are created equal -- and hence one of the new major simulation features of Command: variable drone autonomy levels.</p> <p>The question of how much autonomy we are willing to grant to conscious-less machines armed with lethal weaponry has long escaped the confines of legal &amp; ethical theoretical discussions, and is already hammered in the front lines of Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere, as well as the virtual battlefields of the major powers where doctrine, tactics and operational art are forged (see this excellent article by Bill Sweetman on the dilemmas of how best to employ CCAs in a future peer conflict).</p> <p>Public western/NATO literature on the subject commonly refers to different degrees of \"drone autonomy\" and then assigns individual uncrewed systems to each of them, to distinguish their autonomous capability. The dev team's chosen structure closely (though not precisely) follows this public nomenclature. Let us explore the different levels and what they actually mean in the field, when their comms are lost:</p> <p>-- Remotely Piloted: These are the cheap &amp; cheerful quadcopters or small-sized wingcraft or UGVs/USVs you can buy at your local store and have up and flying / rolling / sailing within minutes. Due to their low cost and high numbers, they are very popular in battlefields where comms are not contested. They are remotely-piloted and entirely dependent on their human operator for control. If comms are disrupted, they will stick with their last-ordered course and speed until comms are re-established; if they are not, then they'll run out of fuel/energy and halt in place (or crash if airborne). While offline, they are unable to take any initiative in order to further their mission.</p> <p>-- Self-Recovering: Things are slightly improving here; if the comms link is lost, these units will loiter/hold at their current location and try to rejoin the comms grid; if successful they will resume their mission, otherwise they will autonomously return to their deployment base/host. It doesn't sound like much, but retrieving back effortlessly your comms-disrupted force rather than losing them to every comms-jammer out there really does make a difference.</p> <p>-- Changeable Mission: (A more accurate description here might be \"Flexible in-mission behavior\", but we don't get to choose the terminology). A pretty significant jump in autonomy here: The offline vehicle will actually move ahead and try to perform its assigned mission. The bad news: Because of the lack of human oversight, the platform will not perform any pre-emptive checks for own damage, bingo/joker fuel status or winchester/shotgun weapon status -- checks that (under human supervision &amp; positive control) would trigger an immediate abort &amp; RTB. In other words, it will press on to its mission even if it is objectively incapable of actually pulling it off and surviving.</p> <p>-- Fault/Event Adaptive: Another major step forward in intelligent behavior here: The platform will actually perform pre-emptive checks for own damage, bingo/joker fuel status or winchester/shotgun weapon status, and thus will avoid needlessly kamikazeing itself into a hopeless situation.</p> <p>-- Multi-Vehicle Coordination: Drones can be quite more effective when they are used in big groups (aka \"swarms\"). This level of autonomy allows a drone to participate in such a group -- but only strictly as a group member. It can perform independent maneuvers only if it is the group's designated leader.</p> <p>-- Battlespace Cognizant: This is an absolutely huge leap forward, and allows an offline unit to finally evaluate targets and threats on its own, rather than sticking to pre-assigned targets only. It can also maneuvers independently even if its part of a swarm, it can intelligently change its desired home base (though only from available fixed bases, not mobile bases like aircraft carriers) and can evaluate UNREP or air-to-air-refueling opportunities.</p> <p>-- Fully Autonomous: Now we are stepping firmly into Cyberdyne Systems territory. Fully-autonomous drones treat comms isolation almost as a nuisance rather than a crippling handicap: In addition to freely evaluating the targets &amp; threats within their predefined mission parameters, they are also free to evaluate and engage any targets of opportunity that are relevant to their available weaponry. They are also able to modify their mission course instead of sticking to their predefined one, as well as changing their home base destination, either fixed or mobile. Such a unit will most definitely ask you for your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle -- and you'll be wise to accede. If the thought of heavily-armed robots having this freedom of action doesn't give you pause, you might had been an excellent Carmageddon player.</p> <p>The autonomy level of a drone is displayed on the DB viewer:</p> <p></p> <p>It is also accessible (and editable) through the Lua API:</p> <p>theU = ScenEdit_GetUnit({name='Anka-S UAV', guid='4FTZEE-0HNA5SMK3O9K4'}) theU.autonomylevel = 1500 print(theU.autonomylevel)</p> <p>(Note: In DB3000 v510 and previous versions, most drones have their stock autonomy level set to \"Undefined\". We therefore recommend using v511+ when using this feature)</p> <p>One common characteristic of off-grid drones is that, when they get disconnected from their side network, their mission becomes \"fixed\" for them. In simulation terms, they obtain and use a \"private snapshot\" copy of their mission state as it was at the moment of disconnect, and use that as reference. Any changes on their original assigned mission are NOT reflected on their private snapshot; for example if the doctrine or ROE settings change, or the area of a patrol shifts around, the disconnected drone sticks to its \"known\" mission parameters; this is one of the key operational drawbacks of even the most advanced autonomous drones.</p> <p>The Mission Editor has been adjusted to display such \"snapshot\" missions, if they are the selected ones (for example, if the player is in direct control of an isolated drone and selects its mission):</p> <p></p> <p>The ME window now also more clearly displays platforms who are assigned to a mission but are currently off-grid:</p> <p></p> <p>When a unit is off-grid, any attempts to transfer it to another mission or change its mission parameters will fail.</p> <p>Variable drone autonomy levels is an opt-in scenario realism feature (disabled by default, to avoid disrupting existing scenarios).

Drones have different autonomy levels which dictate what they can and cannot do when they are comms-isolated (which is a common predicament in a comms-challenged peer-conflict battlespace). If you thought the flying hunter-killers in Terminator were a bit too sci-fi, prepare to be amazed.</p> <p>Static on the radio: Comms jamming comes to commercial CMO</p> <p>Ever since comms disruption and its effects were introduced in Command back in 2017, comms jamming as an attack vector was available only in Command-PE. While it was possible to simulate it in CMO as well (look at the \"Bekaa Valley\" scenario in the \"Shifting Sands\" campaign), this required some Lua scripting. Given that the main way to disrupt comms is through jamming, and the importance of this attack vector in disrupting drone communications (and thus highlighting their different autonomy levels) it now makes sense to bring script-less comms jamming also to the commercial version of Command.</p> <p>If you need a refresher on the effects of having the command and control over your units abruptly cut off, have a look at our original coverage on this feature. Suffice to say, a number of things happen when your radios &amp; datalinks are chocked with static, none of them good.</p> <p>Grand vistas: 3D Terrain view and vertical scaling</p> <p>This may be seen as the next evolutionary step for the map UI after the (enthusiastically received) \"pin-cushion\" view. In addition to showing aerospace units at their true altitudes, it is now possible to display the terrain itself in top-down stereoscopic 3D (users of Google Earth or other GIS apps should be familiar with this). This can be useful for both air and ground operations, in better appreciating vertical differences and understanding how the terrain geometry limits available operational options. Phil Gatcomb has already covered this new feature, check it out.</p> <p>An army runs on doctrine and diesel: Doctrine &amp; ROE UI/UX improvements</p> <p>This has been a popular user request: While the various doctrine &amp; ROE options are ridiculously powerful and flexible (and they explain why we don't have to artificially nerf/OP hardware in order to recreate historical results), keeping track of them and being aware of possible conflicts between them or other issues can sometimes be a chore.</p> <p>So, we set out to radically improve the UI and user experience on this vital aspect of Command:</p> <p></p> <p>Instead of having all baseline doctrine options crammed in a single panel, they are now logically divided by operational branch, in a pseudo-tabbed interface. This makes it faster to locate the options of interest and also allows more space for future additions.</p> <p>Moreover, the population of options can be dynamically adjusted depending on the type of the selected platform (so for example, if you select a friendly submarine, options related to air operations are not shown). In this example, a single ship is selected, and only the doctrine settings that are relevant to surface ships are displayed:</p> <p></p> <p>We asked you if you still wanted/used the quick-access panel for the doctrine options on the right-hand column, and you overwhelmingly said no (and we agreed). So, we ripped that off and replaced it with something you will probably find more useful: An intelligent mechanism for detecting common doctrine-related problems or conflicts and (semi-automatically, with user consent) correcting them. Here is an example of a common issue (conflict between mission- and unit-level WRA setting) being detected and a notice presented to the player, who can then resolve this with just a single button click (click on animation to enlarge):</p> <p></p> <p>The system is deliberately extensible so that it can be further enriched in the future with other common issues encountered, as highlighted by community feedback. So, tell us what torments you on doctrine management, and we can try to encapsulate the solution there.</p> <p>When men were men, and missiles slammed into hills: Early anti-ship missile overland restrictions</p> <p>Here's something you may not have realized until now: Early low-flying anti-ship missiles (from granddaddy P-15 Termit/SS-N-2 \"Styx\" up to and including the first versions of Exocet and Harpoon) had rather primitive systems to keep them flying safely above the sea waves. These early guidance systems (simple radar altimeters or even just gyroscopes) were designed primarily for sea-skimming flight, relying on a relatively flat sea surface to maintain a consistent altitude. They were therefore limited in their ability to follow flight paths that took them overland. When directed overland, the missiles encountered varied terrain such as hills, ridges, or buildings, which their rudimentary altimeters could not detect or adjust for. As a result, the missiles were unable to compensate for elevation changes and often crashed into the ground before reaching their targets.</p> <p>Now if you are in the middle of the Atlantic or in the North Sea, shooting every Harpoon at hand against the incoming Soviet/Russian Northern Fleet, this doesn't matter much. But if you are playing hide-and-seek in, say, the Norwegian fjords, the Swedish archipelago, the Aegean Sea or the strait of Malacca, it becomes a real constraining factor real fast.</p> <p>Post-Cold War littoral operations emphasized this handicap even more, and as a result evolved guidance systems from the mid-90s onwards addressed this limitation. New systems like LRASM, NSM or Onyx/Yakhont (SS-N-26 Strobile), as well as evolved iterations of older classics like Exocet Block 3 or Harpoon Block 2 have no problem navigating themselves overland, even often using the terrain to their advantage in order to surprise a target ship near the coast.</p> <p>Command now models this factor with a new opt-in realism option: \"ASCM terrain-following restrictions\" (disabled by default, to avoid disruption on existing scenarios). When this feature is active, early ASCMs who lack true TF capability cannot overfly land with elevation higher than their cruise altitude (unit is actively blocked from firing, both in auto-fire and also through the manual weapon allocation window). If the weapon is fired nevertheless (e.g. BOL shot) and encounters terrain higher than its cruise altitude, it smashes into it. (This means that is possible, but risky, to fire such missiles over very low-elevation land terrain such as atolls etc. -- just like in real life.)</p> <p>Non-TF ASCMs with waypoint capability (e.g. Harpoon Block 1C) can be fired with a plotted course around landmasses, to avoid the \"land between shooter and target\" restriction when this feature is active. On the manual weapon allocation window, if the selected salvo has a suitable complex course that avoids landmass, non-TF ASCMs show up as \"green\" (can fire).</p> <p>Grinding like a chad: Chainsaw/Grinder patrol movement style</p> <p>Another consistent request from the user community. The grinder or chainsaw patrol pattern is a naval air patrol tactic used to maintain continuous surveillance or presence over a specific area (typically over the sea) by a sequence of aircraft flying overlapping racetrack or circular routes.</p> <p>In this pattern, multiple aircraft (such as maritime patrol planes, airborne early warning aircraft, or fighters) take turns flying long, looping tracks in a coordinated sequence, where one aircraft is always on station while others are en route to or from the patrol zone. As each aircraft nears the end of its time on station, the next aircraft arrives to take over, creating a seamless \"grinding\" or \"sawing\" motion of coverage. This graphic may better illustrate this:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"simulation/#original-credit-httpsxcomrse_vbstatus1897710024937365913","title":"(original credit: https://x.com/RSE_VB/status/1897710024937365913 )","text":"<p>The purpose of the grinder pattern is to provide persistent situational awareness, surveillance, or defensive coverage over critical areas like carrier strike groups, chokepoints, or potential enemy approaches. Its utility lies in efficiently managing limited air assets to ensure that a surveillance or combat-ready presence is maintained 24/7, while allowing for necessary rotations, refueling, and maintenance without leaving gaps in coverage.</p> <p>While this patrol pattern was originally developed primarily for aircraft in an air-surveillance context, Command allows using it for any platform type in any kind of patrol mission (e.g. ships in an ASuW, ASW or sea-control patrol).</p> <p>UPDATE: A late arrival: Depressed-trajectory ballistic missiles</p> <p></p> <p>This is a new feature introduced in Build 1662, during the v1.08 public beta. By default, most ballistic missiles use the lofted/\"high\" trajectory leg when fired at less-than-maximum range. (When the firing range is just a small fraction of the max range, this can result in absurdly high apogees; witness, for example, the recent North Korean missile tests.)</p> <p>Instead, missiles who have the \"depressed trajectory\" capability will use the \"low\" trajectory option in any less-than-maximum range shot. This has several advantages: A reduced flight time, a (much) lower apogee which means a reduced detection range &amp; reaction time for enemy ground-based sensors, and spending a higher portion of the flight inside the atmosphere is very useful for systems that utilize maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs).</p> <p>(NOTE: This feature requires the v512+ databases. Also, initially only the Russian Iskander-M/E and its North Korean analog KN-23 are flagged as such in the database. If you have sources for other systems having the same capability, feel free to share them on the DB tracker: https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/)</p> <p>Other bits of note</p> <ul> <li> <p>A whole lot of improvements and fixes related to airstrike-planning   logics and refueling. If you've given up on a specific scenario (or   historical raid) because you couldn't get the AI to behave exactly as   needed, give it another try now.</p> </li> <li> <p>A longstanding problem with scenario performance degrading due to a   ballooning message backlog has been fixed. If you have developed a   habit of saving &amp; reloading large scenarios every few hours to work   around this, rejoice.</p> </li> <li> <p>The \"significant hiccup every 1 sim-minute if a lot of airstrikes are   preparing to launch\" problem has been fixed.</p> </li> <li> <p>All the scenarios in the \"The Silent Service\" DLC have been   overhauled, with all known issues fixed and various tweaks and   improvements applied.</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerous other scenarios have received various fixes and improvements,   and the DB description files have been updated, courtesy of Steven   Lohr and kgambit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contact datablocks now conform much closer to established NATO &amp; APP-6   standards, discriminating between a contact's track number and its   classification/ID name. The amount of information shown on datablocks   (just track &amp; name? track &amp; name and kinematics? everything?) is now   also configurable, which can help A LOT in decluttering \"busy\" maps.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Sentinel-2 map layer now uses per-zoom-level tile packing, which   allows increased performance and also faster download and   installation, particularly on external hard disks (if the bane of   your CMO Steam installation is \"stuck at 99% FOR HOURS\", this should   be your salvation).</p> </li> <li> <p>The unit-status thumbnail and the DB-viewer now use webp (instead of   jpg) as the image format, which thanks to its greater efficiency both   takes up less space and is much faster to download (You may   temporarily have a shortage of shown images as these are repopulated   from the server on-demand)</p> </li> <li> <p>When running in interactive-GUI mode (not benchmark), the simulation   thread gets set to \"Lowest\" priority. This reduces raw sim-engine   performance, but has two UX benefits:</p> </li> </ul> <p>(a) It reduces the impact of sim execution on UI responsiveness (map zoom/pan lag, general UI lag etc.) and</p> <p>(b) It reduces the impact of sim execution on the overall OS responsiveness (If you've ever observed your entire OS respond sluggishly while an epic missile-spam schlachtfest unfolds in Command, you know).</p> <ul> <li>Plus numerous other additions, tweaks and fixes as laid out in detail   in the release notes.</li> </ul> <p>Overview of War Planner (nicknamed Tiny)</p> <p>Operations Planner: Ever wished you had an ATO-like overview of all missions and operations planned or currently executing, their status and hierarchical priorities and dependencies? With units or even entire task forces automatically switching from one mission to the next as objectives are achieved? Wish no more. The brand-new Operations Planner makes this, and much more, a reality.</p> <p>Multi-Domain Strike Planner: Throw away your planning spreadsheets! You asked/begged/hostaged family members for it, and now it's here. Coordinate massive, complex strike missions with time-on-target, complex flight plans (incl. in-flight refueling) , multiple attack patterns and multi-domain strike combinations. \"Bringing everything together on a strike is just too complex/difficult\" is officially over as an excuse. If you don't master this, your adversary most definitely will.</p> <p>Cargo 2.0: The sub-header for this feature is often \"The Logistician's Nirvana\" -- and that should be your first hint. Transfer both combat units and also weapons, stores, fuel and any arbitrary material. Place your cargo on a multitude of different container types, from standard ISO-blocks to specialized boxes, each with its own peculiarities. Transload cargo at airbases, ports, railyards etc. in order to haul it over even transcontinental distances. Automate all this through cargo and (NEW!) transfer missions. Set up complex logistical chains from mainland factories all the way to the front line. Conquerors from Napoleon to Alexander would have given their right arm for such a tool -- and you get it for free. Who ever said life is fair?</p> <p>Area &amp; Reference Point Manager: Areas, zones, ref-points and overlapping fields oh my! A centralized way to manage anything and everything related to reference points.</p> <p>Custom Environment Zones: Multiple &amp; moving weather fronts? Check. Bend the laws of physics on a localized area? Can do. Specify carefully hand-picked weather, terrain and other environmental properties in order to test or compare sensors and other environment-dependent components? Yup. Unleash your inner nature wizard with this puppy.</p> <p>Air combat mechanics overhaul: Boost-coast AAW missiles (i.e.. the vast majority of them) now correctly accelerate to their maximum speed by their boosters and subsequently coast over the rest of their flight, trading altitude for speed (and vice versa) while also shedding speed due to drag -- especially on sharp maneuvers. This makes them much easier to avoid at the edge of their envelope, where their energy reserves are depleted. Missiles with specialized long-burn motors have a decisive terminal-energy advantage over plain boost-coast systems. Virtual pilots are aware of these new dynamics and will exploit them to \"drag out\" incoming missiles, with beaming/notching as a last resort. To counter these counters, new additional WRA firing-range settings (including \"No-Escape Zone\") are available. A2A and S2A missile engagements are, as a result, both more dynamic and far more realistic now.</p> <p>\"Double-flame\" time acceleration: \"I wish my simulation runs had executed more slowly, I had time to spare\" -- said no-one on their deathbed. Aside from an array of general sim-speed improvements, this update brings a brand-new exclusive (and optional) time accel mode: \"Double Flame\". This cranks up the virtual timeslice to 5 seconds, massively speeding up simulation execution. \"Hold on\", we hear you say, \"bad things start to happen when you get so coarse in your timeslice\". You bet they do. So how did we solve it? Find out in one of our follow-ups.</p> <p>HGVs and D-EMPs now available: Yes Dorothy, the previously available only in CPE hypersonic glide vehicles and directional-EMP weapon types are now available in the commercial version too. Yes, they can be pretty useful if used correctly -- especially in coordination with other, more abundant assets. No, they won't save you from certain doom if the rest of your ops suck. Treat them as magic saviors at your peril.</p> <p>Palletized Weapons &amp; Stores: Yes, we know you've all seen AFRL's videos on the Rapid Dragon concept. Yes, we know you drooled over the new possibilities. Newsflash: So did we. So now you can do that too. Is it awesome? You bet it is.</p> <p>Passive Coherent Location System (PCLS) sensor, aka \"Passive Radar\": How do you detect and track stealth aircraft? One of the possible ways is to break out of the classic monostatic radar paradigm and embrace alternative solutions like PCLS. Are they omniscient? No. Do they have operational drawbacks, some of them quite severe? Yes. In the right conditions, can they detect stealthy aircraft that conventional radars are hopeless against? Yes, yes and yes. Find out how.</p> <p>Intermittent Emissions: Radars and other active emitters no longer have to strictly choose between active and silent: You can now blink, and schedule how to. No scripting necessary! (But scripting still a very powerful option). Find out how, in our follow-up article.</p> <p>Revised Mission Editor: \"It's insanely better than before!\" is the least positive comment we've heard about the revised ME layout. Now you too can experience what every beta player considers the finest visual experience since \"Love Actually: The Directors Cut\".</p> <p>Revised Message Log: You asked (intensely and consistently...) for a fully filterable message log, dynamically enabling/disabling messages per type, while also retaining the \"responsive nature\" (show location, optionally show balloon etc.) of the messages. Oh and also keeping all the existing goodies (docked or free-floating, \"raw\"/waterfall mode, per-type coloring, balloons etc.). Our first reaction was \"So, you essentially want Visual Studio's errors &amp; warnings list?\" Our second reaction was \"Maybe this is feasible after all\". Our third reaction was to go ahead and build it. And there was much rejoicing throughout the land.</p> <p>Distinct Ground Units: As much as we keep telling you Command is not SPMBT or Combat Mission, you keep asking for distinct ground vehicles. So there you go. Command now offers individual ground units, in addition to the previous method of modeling them as aimpoint-facilities. You'll find ground units modeled with the same level of detail users expect of ships and aircraft: propulsion, fuel, mounts, sensors, etc. are all simulated, as are characteristics like armor (incl. ERA, slat armor, etc.). Ground units bring brand-new capabilities to the fight, such as amphibious vehicles capable of transitioning between land and water (with distinct speeds and fuel consumption in each domain).</p> <p>Save/Load Doctrine &amp; ROE Settings: Sorry, Cimmerian; crushing your enemies and seeing them driven before you is only the _second_ best thing in life. The first-best, is to carefully construct your Doctrine &amp; Rules of Engagement settings for a specific side, mission, group or individual unit, and then export them to a text file where they can be freely re-imported for any other simulation object as well as edited, either by hand or in an automated fashion. With power such as this in one's hands, no prayers to Crom are necessary.</p> <p>Overhauled Reaction Times: The differences in reaction times, and their effects, are now more critical than ever. All units use common-reference \"Combat System Generation\" (\"Cockpit Generation\" for aircraft) to model the modernity of their combat systems, combined with an \"Ergonomics\" value to handle intra-generation differences (the atrocious switchology on early missile-age aircraft will most definitely get you killed now). Older, WW2-era ships may take up to 5 minutes to engage a target, while Aegis cruisers fire in \\&lt;20 seconds. Cold War fighters will be beaten to the draw by modern, fifth-generation fighters. Overmatch, that ever-elusive dream, is now possible -- but beware, it goes both ways.</p> <p>IR &amp; Visual Sensor Improvements: IRSTs and high-mag cameras are no longer near-magical counter-VLO sensors. They may still be your best bet for detection, but you won't be volume-scanning for stealth fighters at &gt;100nm anymore. (You can still spot/track them pretty far enough IF something/someone else first cues you there)</p> <p>Radar &amp; IR Stealth Improvements: Sensor improvements come coupled with a massive overhaul of signature modifiers in the DB, which significantly improve the realism of our stealth model by drawing clearer distinctions between shaping and RAM generations. We also added special DB \"flags\" to indicate the presence (or lack) of certain stealthy design features such as S-shaped intakes, exposed fan blockers, active cancellation, and stealth pylons. The overhaul also extended to IR modifiers, which now not only model whole-aircraft IRSS (distributed vs. conventional fuel tanks, low-E coatings) but also specific IRSS features such as shielded \"anti-Strela\" exhausts, masked exhausts, heavily masked / slit-shaped exhausts, and peak temperature reduction or \"cool-air mixing\".</p> <p>Formation Presets: Tailor your formation's layout with a number of different presets (wedge, circle, echelon, line, diamond etc.) or make and store your own custom template. Customize facing and distancing to suit your preferences. Transitioning from parade to full-attack and back (perhaps in the middle of your parade?) has never been easier.</p> <p>Bathymetry Layer: Visualize the terrain contours of the naval domain as clearly and as richly as you already do for the overland globe surface. A must for every facet of underwater ops, from sub/ASW hunts to mine warfare to UUV control to tracking whale migrations. Jacques Cousteau would have rightly wept.</p> <p>Graphical Satellite Pass Display: The \"Satellite Pass Prediction\" window now offers a graphical representation of future satellite passes, sparing users the need to compare timeblocks to figure out which satellites will be overhead when. Who needs data grids when you can visually compare availability windows.... right?</p> <p>Benchmark Mode: Looking to compare rigs? Command now includes a benchmark mode, which will repeatedly run any scenario you choose in \"headless\" mode and output performance metrics. Now your machine's sorry state will be plain for all the world to see.</p> <p>Miscellaneous UI Improvements (Weapon Quick-Allocate, Slug Trails, \"Barks,\" etc.): Quickly allocate weapons manually, without needing to bring up the (intimidating to some, apparently...) manual allocation window. Have units or contacts bark to each other (yes, you read that right). Make unit &amp; contact movement paths &amp; histories more obvious (and easier to visualize in a screenshot) by enabling \"slug trails\". Plus a few more tricks we'll see in detail on the UI-dedicated UI follow-up.</p> <p>Weather effects on ship seakeeping: Sea state limits are no longer treated as hard lines. Smaller ships are now affected by progressively higher sea states, which will slow their max speed but not necessarily immobilize them. Moving from the QE to a small sloop now most definitely feels like it.</p> <p>Aircraft Max Endurance: If you've ever used the \"keep aircraft in the air indefinitely through repeated air-refueling\" cheat, first: SHAME ON YOU! Second: You won't be able to do it anymore. Aircraft are now limited in persistence both by their onboard consumables and also crew fatigue. And you wonder why everyone loves drones.</p> <p>The Operations Planner https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5486</p> <p>Ever wished you had an ATO-like overview of all missions and operations planned or currently executing, their status and hierarchical priorities and dependencies? With units or even entire task forces automatically switching from one mission to the next as objectives are achieved? Wish no more. The brand-new Operations Planner makes this, and much more, a reality.</p> <p>To fully comprehend this function, it is essential to have a good knowledge of the mission editor in general, and cargo missions in particular. Previously, in Command, a given unit could only be assigned to a single mission. If you wanted to assign the unit to another mission, you would have to manually unassign it from the current mission and then assign it to a new one.</p> <p>Before we begin: Some nomenclature</p> <p>Triggers</p> <p>A trigger in the operations planner is a condition that gets checked each simulated second. If the conditions are met the trigger will execute a specific action. There are two possible actions: start a mission or tag a mission as satisfied.</p> <p>Mission status</p> <p>A mission's status in Command can be either Active or Inactive.</p> <p>Active means the mission is evaluated by the Command simulation, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the mission serves a purpose or has units assigned to execute it.</p> <p>Inactive means that the mission is completely ignored by the simulation until it becomes Active.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to leave all missions active, especially when working with the operations planner. Set mission as inactive only for draft missions or manually controlled missions.</p> <p>Mission phases</p> <p>A mission phase is a new concept introduced with the operations planner and is not related to the existing mission status:</p> <p>\"On Hold\":</p> <p>The mission has not yet started, the units assigned to the mission won't execute the mission.</p> <p>\"Satisfied\":</p> <p>The mission is considered to have achieved enough of its objective for assigned units to consider other missions, but a satisfied mission does not necessarily end. This tag is used for mission triggers and for multi-mission priority.</p> <p>\"Running\":</p> <p>A running mission will have its assigned mission to execute the mission.</p> <p>\"H-Hour\":</p> <p>In Command, H-Hour designates the date and time at which the mission designated as the initial mission for H-Hour is to start. H-Hour in Command isn't strictly an H-hour according military terminology as it can be customized without restriction.</p> <p>\"L-Hour\":</p> <p>In Command, L-Hour designates the date and time at which the mission designated as the initial mission for L-Hour is to start. L-Hour in Command isn't strictly an L-hour according military terminology as it can be customized without restriction.</p> <p>Understanding the concept of dynamic (aka. multi-missioned) units</p> <p>The operations planner provides the capability for a single unit to be assigned to multiple missions. Of course, the unit can only execute one mission at a time, but you can now prioritize which mission it should execute. Mission priority is set via the operations planner.</p> <p>Let's assume we have a scenario where a group of aircrafts is assigned to a patrol mission. These aircrafts should patrol an area from a given time and then start a strike mission against a group of tanks. Without the operations planner, the player would need to track the time and then manually switch each aircraft to a new mission, at the right moment. Thanks to the operations planner such behavior can be automated, and in a more complex environment, our units could even behave like a reactive AI, aware of the simulation at the strategic level.</p> <p>IMPORTANT ! A unit without \"Dynamic\" Checked will be ignored by the operations planner dynamic assignment, if you want a unit to work with the operations planner's feature you MUST designate it as a dynamic unit.</p> <p>Notice that since we have toggle \"Showing Multi-Mission\" we are now allowed to assign multiple mission to a unit, they are still shown in the \"Available units\" list despite having an assigned mission.</p> <p>This panel on the right side of the mission editor shows all missions assigned to this unit. The mission in green in the one currently executed by the unit. Missions don't have an order of execution, but a priority, which is set in the operations planner, as we will see later.</p> <p>The \"Dynamic\" checkbox allows the unit to be assigned to multiple missions, units are all unchecked by default to reflect default command behavior.</p> <p>Below the mission list we can see the current status and phase of the mission. We will see later in the operations planner chapter as \"Phase\" is a new way of managing the mission dynamically and is closely related to multi-mission:</p> <p>It is on this screen that you decide to add the unit to all of the missions you want it assigned to. At this point you don't have worry about priority or to select a current mission as the operations planner will manage this for you.</p> <p>In above's example we see that Rafale B is assigned to both the \"Air Superiority Patrol\" and \"Light Tanks Destruction\" missions, and the active mission for this unit is the one in green: \"Air Superiority Patrol.\" Depending on the configuration of the operation planer, this unit may automatically switch to the \"Light Tanks Destruction\" mission at some point in the future.</p> <p>Don't worry if the multi-mission mechanism is not entirely clear to you yet, as the mission editor is only half the story. The next chapter on operations planner will explain the other half.</p> <p>Interlude: \"Mobile facility\" vs \"Ground unit\" and Split / Merge ground units</p> <p>One of the most significant capabilities brought by the operations planner, is the possibility to have units dynamically change mission. But not all types of units are eligible for this kind of behavior. As part of that, It is important to understand the core difference between:</p> <p>Ground units as facility which is a legacy implementation where ground units are represented as a moving, multi-aimpoint \"facility\" (see this old post explaining this concept).</p> <p>Mobile ground units, a new implementation, which works like others active units such as aircraft, ships etc.</p> <p>The first hold a group of units abstractly represented as \"mounts\", while the last is a fully simulated individual unit. The core difference that interests us here is that ground units as facility are transported as cargo which doesn't have an existence in the simulation until it has landed (and spawned).</p> <p>This means that we can't assign or queue them a mission until they have landed, and you will not be able to achieve a fully autonomous behavior for your units, in this case.</p> <p>Cargo operations are now enabled for active units, meaning that all these limitations are now removed. However, you must have the right methodology to achieve this.</p> <p>Unless you have to achieve backward compatibility or if a database entry is missing, you MUST use ground units, NOT mobiles facilities, to use the operations planner at its fullest.</p> <p>On the new cargo edition form, note the \"type\", at the moment, the database has more content for mobile facilities:</p> <p>Ability to Split/Merge ground units (facilities)</p> <p>Legacy ground units associated as \"facilities\" can now be rearranged through this new tool.</p> <p>Select an eligible unit, such as a landed detachment, right click on it to bring the context menu and click on \"Split unit\":</p> <p>This brings you this menu, with the details of the detachment:</p> <p>You can also break the detachment into individual units with a single click:</p> <p>Two eligible units can be merged together:</p> <p>The Operations Planner</p> <p>The operations planner adds a new level of interaction between missions and allows units to be dynamically reassigned from one mission to another.</p> <p>Since the operations planner is sometimes tied to a landing plan, we have here the concepts of H-Hour and L-Hour to indicate overall operational time. These can of course be ignored, or used in a different purpose:</p> <p>On the top left, one can define the H-Hour and the L-Hour values.</p> <p>The H-Hour box on the left is where we can define the date and time to start the H-Hour mission. The H-Hour mission is the initial mission in the operation. L-Hour box works identically to H-Hour but they are independent.</p> <p>Once an H-Hour or L-Hour is hit the respective initial mission can no longer be changed.</p> <p>The checkbox in the middle ties the H-Hour to the L-Hour, meaning that the time separation will be constant between H-Hour and L-Hour when you modify the time for either.</p> <p>The spreadsheet in the center lists all the side's missions. Most columns are informational. Generally, you will be dealing with 2 columns: Priority and Phase.</p> <p>Mission priority</p> <p>The priority of a mission does NOT designate his supposed position in a mission execution queue. It indicates to its assigned units how important this mission is at this moment. The mission priority is used by units assigned to multiple missions to decide which mission to execute at any given time.</p> <p>A unit having a mission in \"On Hold\" phase will not have this mission evaluated for the active mission evaluation.</p> <p>Mission phases</p> <p>A mission phase is a new concept introduced with the operations planner extension, it is not related to the mission status and should not be mistaken with it:</p> <p>Waiting for trigger: The mission may (or may not) have already started yet but queued units won't evaluate this mission when choosing one to be assigned to.</p> <p>Satisfied: The mission is considered to have achieved enough of its objective for its current assigned dynamic units to consider other missions, but a satisfied mission does not mean its ending. This tag is used for mission triggers and for multi-mission priority.</p> <p>Triggered : A running mission will become a valid candidate for multi-mission units assigned to it. Therefore, a queued unit to this mission may become assigned to it.</p> <p>A unit assigned to multiple missions will pick the most appropriate mission to be assigned to, based on the priority and the phase of the mission. unless it is already active on a mission that is in \"running\" phase, or if all assigned missions are in \"On Hold\" phase.</p> <p>A unit that is active in a mission in \"Satisfied\" phase will still evaluate the satisfied mission and may continue that mission if no other missions are available.</p> <p>Name</p> <p>Just like for operation, the mission's name helps for organization. However user's made Lua scripts might reference a mission by its name and it is recommended to be careful when changing mission's name in such situation.</p> <p>Description</p> <p>This is purely an informational tag and does not affect the simulation at the moment. Use and edit this field to organize yourself.</p> <p>Generated mission will usually contain some generated information</p> <p>Type</p> <p>This is the mission sub type as defined in Command's simulation.</p> <p>Execution Time</p> <p>The time, relative to H-Hour at which the mission is estimated to begin. See the chapter \"Working with estimation\" for more details.</p> <p>Bulk actions</p> <p>Bulk action tools are located on the bottom of the operations planner. These are used to select multiple mission at once and perform simultaneous modifications on them:</p> <p>Filter</p> <p>The filter tool is used to do a specific term research on mission and filter the result of this search query:</p> <p>Triggers</p> <p>This chapter is the core of the operations planner capabilities. It allows relationships between mission and a dynamic approach when executing missions.</p> <p>A trigger is like a set of a condition and an action, if the condition is met, then we do an action.</p> <p>Command evaluates all these triggers every second.</p> <p>For mission, there are 2 types of actions:</p> <p>We start a mission (we set the mission's phase as \"Running\").</p> <p>We finish a mission (we set the mission's phase as \"Satisfied\").</p> <p>It is important to understand that Command doesn't have a concept of mission completion, when tagging a mission as satisfied, command only indicates that the mission have enough fulfilled its objective to allow its assigned units to evaluate other mission assignment options. Of course, all relevant missions have already implicit mission completion mechanisms, a cargo mission will stop operation once the task is done, a strike mission won't launch again to strike a nonexistent targets, etc.</p> <p>These 2 actions are tied to a set of conditions.</p> <p>Starting a mission with triggers</p> <p>Select any of the mission and look on the right side of the operations planner window. Notice the main block called \"Triggers to Start Mission\", and how it is separated into 3 smaller blocks:</p> <p>These smaller blocks are individual conditions. Checking them means this specific condition will be evaluated.</p> <p>The dropdown on the right of each smaller block is called a conditional operator.</p> <p>As you can see there are 3 types of triggers that can start a missions:</p> <p>A time based trigger</p> <p>A mission dependency trigger</p> <p>A Lua script trigger</p> <p>Time-based trigger</p> <p>This will be triggered when the scenario date reaches the defined H-Hour plus or minus a given duration.</p> <p>Example #1 : This trigger will be true if we reach H+ 2 hours</p> <p>Example #2 : This trigger will be true if we reach H- 23 hours</p> <p>Mission dependency trigger</p> <p>This will be triggered if all missions in \"missions to check\" are in \"Satisfied\" phase.</p> <p>In this example, it will be triggered when \"Air Superiority Patrol\" mission is in \"Satisfied\" Phase:</p> <p>Lua script trigger</p> <p>This will be triggered if the Lua script contained returns TRUE as a value:</p> <p>\"Finishing\" a mission with triggers</p> <p>It was mentioned earlier that Command does not have an explicit concept of finished mission.</p> <p>The triggers to tag a mission as \"satisfied\" work just like the one to start it.</p> <p>The first trigger is a time based one, it tracks the elapsed time since the mission's phase has been set to \"Running\" and will be true once the defined time elapsed.</p> <p>The second one is a Lua script trigger and work identically to the one in the mission start trigger -- it returns the Boolean value of the contained lua script.</p> <p>Logical Operators</p> <p>Triggers, in Command, can be tied with logical operators.</p> <p>Take a look at the picture on the right, representing a set of triggers to start a mission:</p> <p>We have set all 3 triggers to be checked. On the right of each triggers you can notice a dropdown when you can selected either the OR or AND operator.</p> <p>For the triggers to return TRUE and therefore start the mission (set its phase to \"Running\") each checked trigger is evaluated.</p> <p>We see in this example that the first trigger has \"OR\" operator, the second \"AND,\" the third \"OR.\"</p> <p>What it means in this situation is that the second trigger (the one with \"AND\") must be true.</p> <p>In addition the \"AND\" trigger needing to be true, either of the first or third \"OR\" triggers must also be true.</p> <p>If all conditions are met and the current mission's phases is \"On Hold\" then the mission will change it phase to \"Running\".</p> <p>Another example (left):</p> <p>All triggers are checked (and will be evaluated), and each of them have the \"AND\" operator.</p> <p>This means that the missions will start when all conditions are true.</p> <p>Operations planner and Lua Scripting</p> <p>Command has already a powerful Lua scripting framework. The operations planner allows the integration of your script as a trigger.</p> <p>Clicking on \"Edit Script\" in either the \"Triggers to Start Mission\" or the \"Triggers to Tag Mission as Satisfied\" group will bring you to an interface where you can add your script in:</p> <p>Just like the rest of the triggers, the Lua Script trigger will be executed each second for its associated mission. The Lua script must return a Boolean.</p> <p>Working with estimation</p> <p>Command is such a complex simulation that giving an accurate estimation of an operation duration could take up to hours of computation. The operations planner provides an instantaneous estimation at the price of reliability.</p> <p>The operations planner estimation takes into account all the time based triggers and mission dependencies, it simulates a run and then display the estimated execution tie for each mission.</p> <p>This estimation work only thanks to the user's input on triggers.</p> <p>The special case of Lua script</p> <p>You may have noticed that not all triggers are time-based, some depends on lua script and cannot be reliably predicted. In this case, you will have to manually input a value into the trigger in this trigger, shown on the right.</p> <p>It is not necessary to check (enable) the trigger, having an unchecked \"Time Elapsed\" trigger with a value basically tells the operations planner : \"Only use this trigger when estimating execution time\". In this example, we assume the mission will be satisfied after 1 hour:</p> <p>If everything is properly configured, clicking on the \"Simulate\" button will calculate the execution time, relative to H-Hour for each mission:</p> <p>The Multi-Domain Strike Planner https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5492</p> <p>Throw away your planning spreadsheets! You asked/begged/hostaged family members for it, and now it's here. Coordinate massive, complex strike missions with time-on-target, complex flight plans (incl. in-flight refueling) , multiple attack patterns and multi-domain strike combinations. \"Bringing everything together on a strike is just too complex/difficult\" is officially over as an excuse. If you don't master this, your adversary most definitely will.</p> <p>Poolside party: Task Pools</p> <p>You have 8 bases across your scenarios, in every base there are 5 B-52 Stratofortress, and you want to assign a specific set of missions to a specific subgroup of those Buffs. Sounds painful?</p> <p>No more!</p> <p>With the brand-new Task Pool feature you can now easily create logical clusters of units and be able to operate them effortlessly in a large scenario like never before.</p> <p>From the new and improved Mission Editor (F11)</p> <p>Select Add,</p> <p>from the popup select Task Pool,</p> <p>then assign a name to the Task Pool just created:</p> <p>You will now see the Task Pool just created (light blue circular symbol), the list of available units (round shaped green rectangle) and the list of units assigned to the Task Pool (orange rectangle).</p> <p>Press the Arrow shaped buttons to manage the units into the Task Pool:</p> <p>4 B-52s are added to the Task Pool just created:</p> <p>This will let you quickly assign one or more Packages to those aircraft, allowing you to rapidly access to this specific set of units without having to search for them in your scenario.</p> <p>This feature can be viewed like a more nuanced and detailed version of \"Control Groups\", that are available in a large quantity of modern RTS. Task Pools let you create a cluster of units that are not forced to work together in any way, giving you a new way of interacting with multiple units at the same time.</p> <p>Going the extra mile: Packages</p> <p>The concept of Packages is deeply connected to the concept of Task Pool. Once you create a Task Pool, you can define one or more Packages to be executed exclusively by those units.</p> <p>This link is immediately defined when you create a Package. In Mission Editor, click on Add and select Packages. Here, you'll need to define a Name and a Parent Pool, like in the image below:</p> <p>You will now see the Package just created as a child of the Task Pool (light blue circular symbol), the list of units that are in the parent Task Pool, (round shaped green rectangle) and the list of units assigned to the Package (orange rectangle):</p> <p>As before, you can press the Arrow-shaped buttons to manage the units into the Package.</p> <p>You can interact with the Packages just like you would in a normal Mission. Expect every functionality to be the same, and every setting to work exactly in the same way. The only limitation would be that only units from the parent Task Pool can be assigned to the target Package. The Task Pool is acting like a filter, lifting the encumbrance of having to look for that specific subset of units every time you need it.</p> <p>30 mins or the next one's free: Time On Target (TOT) and Take/Off Time</p> <p>Do you need a specific place to be blown exactly at 18:00:00 ?</p> <p>We got you covered!</p> <p>With the new TOT feature you will be able to schedule precise multi-domain Package in minute detail.</p> <p>After creating a Strike Mission or Package, added the desired units and defined a target, you can now define a Time On Target (TOT) (light blue circle); then, click on CREATE or UPDATE flight plans (green rounded square):</p> <p>The simulation has now created a detailed Flight plan for all the units involved in the Mission, taking into account the inserted time constraint. This Flight plans are visible from the Flight plan Editor Accessible from the appropriate button (orange square).</p> <p>Let's analyse the Flight plan Editor in detail:</p> <p>In the light blue circle, you can see the Flight name.</p> <p>On the map, the Flight plan is visible as shown into the orange square.</p> <p>Every Waypoint is shown in complete details, and you can examine and change type, time and speed of every Waypoint, as long as the physical constraints are respected.</p> <p>You can also add or move most of the Waypoint. Every change is reflected in real time on the game map and vice versa, giving you complete freedom when customizing your Flight plans.</p> <p>The TOT constraint is a multi-domain element that lets you precisely synchronize complex multi-domain strikes: Just add another type of unit to the mission with a TOT assigned, and every unit will hold its weapon until the firing time comes. The firing time is constantly re-evaluated and takes into account if the target or the firing unit moves.</p> <p>In the example below, the aircraft has taken off at the expected Take-Off Time and will arrive on target at the expected TOT, but the ship did not fire yet:</p> <p>The ship fired its weapon according to the weapon ETA:</p> <p>and the weapons reached the target at the common expected TOT:</p> <p>Seven sim-seconds after this screenshot was taken, both the string of iron bombs (notice the aircraft that released them is already breaking clear) and the ship-launched cruise missiles impacted concurrently on their targets.</p> <p>Any which way you can: Attack Methods</p> <p>You can define a wide array of attack patterns for your air strike, including -- but not limited to -- Multi staked TOT with various degrees of separation, single axis and split action. This will let you further customize your strike plans without the need to manually define those attack maneuvers every time:</p> <p>As with the flight planner, every Waypoint can still be dragged and customized as seen fit.</p> <p>A sip in mid-air: Air-to-Air Refuel (AAR) Scheduling</p> <p>This is a more advanced topic and one of the most requested features.</p> <p>In the screenshot below, a Task Pool and a Package were created alongside a Support Mission:</p> <p>From the Flight plan Editor of the Strike Package, Waypoint Number 7 (on the Egress leg of the flight) was selected and a new Waypoint was added. The added Waypoint (generated as the 8th one of the route) default type is \"turning point\" but it was redefined as a refuel point:</p> <p>As soon as the Waypoint 8 is reached, the aircraft that are part of the flight will head toward the tanker and be refueled.</p> <p>Cargo 2.0 -- The main points https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5496</p> <p>Command's existing cargo system was hitherto geared more towards the transfer of combat forces &amp; personnel rather than materiel. This changes radically with Cargo 2.0. You can now transfer both combat units and also weapons, stores, fuel and any arbitrary material. Place your cargo on a multitude of different container types, from standard ISO-blocks to specialized boxes, each with its own peculiarities. Transload cargo at airbases, ports etc. in order to haul it over even transcontinental distances. Automate all this through cargo and (new) transfer missions. Set up complex logistical chains from mainland factories all the way to the front line. Expeditionary commanders from Napoleon to Alexander and Eisenhower would have given their right arm for such a tool -- and it's now included in Command for free.</p> <p>Mission Editor / Mission Behavior Changes</p> <p>(New UI elements circled in red)</p> <p>A new cargo-oriented mission type has been added and the original type of cargo mission has been renamed. The existing cargo mission behavior is now called a 'Delivery' cargo mission. The new cargo mission type is a 'Transfer' cargo mission.</p> <p>Delivery cargo missions work as before, with the destination being a zone defined by RPs on the map. This type of mission will unload cargo into action / for use in the simulation (units will unload from cargo onto the map where they can be given orders, etc. Ammo and fuel will move into unit fuel records / magazines.)</p> <p>Transfer cargo missions, on the other hand, are for moving cargo from one holding unit to another --from airbase to airbase, port to port, or supply facility to airbase, etc. The cargo is not unloaded onto the map but instead moved from the starting cargo source into one of the transporting units assigned to the mission, transported to the destination, and then moved from the transporting unit into destination unit's cargo.</p> <p>Creating a Transfer cargo mission uses the same procedure as creating a ferry mission -- select a destination unit (rather than a group of reference points) before you create the new mission.</p> <p>Ships and aircraft transfer or deliver cargo from their starting host unit. Ground units assigned to a cargo missions should start the scenario loaded as cargo within the source unit (i.e. a ship, fixed facility, airbase, etc.) They will automatically exit cargo and appear on the map as soon as the mission activates and they are within range of the mission destination.</p> <p>Move All Cargo From All Available Sources: This is a new option for any cargo mission to move all the cargo from the available source(s). You can click this checkbox instead of having to manually go through and assign every possible cargo item. It also allows cargo to 'flow' through a system of cargo missions without the sim needing to know what cargo is / is not going to be transferred to a cargo source by some other cargo mission.</p> <p>Vehicles Stored in Cargo May Self-Transfer: This is a new option found on the 'Transfer To' tab for cargo transfer missions. Setting this option 'on' allows ground units (not mobile facilities or other cargo) that are assigned to the cargo mission to transport themselves from the starting cargo source to the destination unit's cargo. They will exit cargo onto the map, travel to the destination unit, and then enter the cargo of the destination unit. In order for this to work the ground unit needs to be in the mission source's cargo, assigned to the mission, AND in the list of cargo to be transported (or you have the 'move all' option set to on.)</p> <p>Cargo / Edit Cargo Changes</p> <p>A new cargo type, 'container', is now available (NOTE: DB v493 or later is required). Cargo containers are added/removed from cargo the same as other types of cargo. Once a container has been added to cargo you can select it from the current cargo list on the left and click 'Edit Container' to put other cargo inside the selected container.</p> <p>Cargo containers can contain ammunition, fuel, or user-defined contents. User-defined contents can be assigned a name, size, and mass via the Edit Container window. Containers are loaded and moved in the same manner as other cargo types but cannot be unloaded directly to the map as independent entities -- they are always in cargo.</p> <p>If cargo containers are moved as part of a cargo delivery mission they will be delivered into nearby (within 2nm) existing supply-type facilities if possible, or a new 'forward arming and refueling point' facility will be created to hold the containers if none are available.</p> <p>Fuel in cargo containers that is delivered via a cargo delivery mission will be added as available fuel of the destination facility. This fuel can then be used by other units to refuel.</p> <p>Ammunition in cargo containers that is delivered via a cargo delivery mission will go into the magazine of the destination facility. These can be used to rearm other units that use the same ammunition type (NOTE: Check the DB ID number to confirm your cargo ammunition matches the type used by the unit you want to re-supply).</p> <p>User-Defined Cargo: This is a catch-all type of cargo for items the user wishes to move and track as cargo but which have no effect within the Command simulation. User-defined cargo can be used to track the movement and delivery of items like food, medical supplies, spare parts, etc.</p> <p>Chaining multiple Cargo Missions</p> <p>A single cargo mission can handle movement of cargo from the assigned source(s) to one destination. By using the 'Move All Cargo' option, however, you can create a sequence of cargo missions to ultimately move cargo through a series of intermediate destinations and on to delivery in the field -- or in an extreme example, move material from homeland factories all the way to the expeditionary frontline. The 'Move All Cargo' option is required for this sort of system, as individual cargo missions do not intrinsically know what cargo may be delivered to their cargo source(s) by other cargo missions.</p> <p>The ability to use multiple cargo missions to route different cargo items from the same source to different destinations is currently limited to 'originating' cargo sources -- i.e. those where you know no other cargo mission will be delivering cargo TO the cargo source.</p> <p>New Game Option: Show US Units of Measure in Cargo Editor</p> <p>This option will change the display values show in the Edit Cargo and Edit Container forms to use US units of measure (feet / square feet / tons / pounds / gallons) rather than metric units. This option applies ONLY to those two forms. The forms will refresh automatically if change the option.</p> <p>Simulation Additions &amp; Improvements https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5500</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Energy-based flight model for boost-coast missiles</p> <p>Boost-coast anti-air missiles (i.e.. most tactical missiles that are not powered continuously) now use a much more realistic flight model that distinctly models the initial boost-sustain and post-burnout regimes, and takes into account the effects of gravity (shedding speed while climbing and regaining it when diving) and aerodynamic drag. The drag changes with altitude, built-in drag coefficient and whether the weapon is maneuvering (pitching/turning) or not. This change makes it possible to apply real-life \"exhaust the threat\" tactics and further constrains edge-of-envelope shots.</p> <p>The onboard fuel (and thus boost duration) varies with the type of missile propulsion. Most AAW missiles (e.g. Sidewinder, Sparrow, all Standards, pre-D AMRAAMs etc.) still rely on the \"traditional\" boost-(optional sustain)-coast sequence, in which case the rocket motor is active usually for a few seconds. Some missiles (SA-4, SA-6, Sea Dart, Meteor etc.) use ramjet propulsion to provide for a much longer burn duration, and this allows them both a much higher average speed-to-target but also a higher energy state on the terminal engagement, which increases their chance of impact. Other new systems like the AIM-120D use \"dual-pulse\" rocket motors to again achieve a substantially higher overall energy state.</p> <p>(NOTE: On missiles that use this model, the \"fuel bar\" indicator now represents only the remaining boost-sustain fuel, NOT to the total remaining energy. After burnout, the fuel bar is removed and the weapon will coast until it reaches its stall speed.)</p> <p>Significant changes in default aircraft defensive maneuvers</p> <p>Instead of beaming and diving to the deck by default, now they will first try to outrun an incoming missile while matching its relative pitch (i.e. climb if the missile is below them, or dive if it's above them), and if the missile closes the distance they will then attempt to beam it (or its parent guidance) while also reversing their climb/dive.</p> <p>To counter these counters, new additional WRA firing-range settings (including \"No-Escape Zone\") are available, offering a much more comprehensive set of range options (see the UI improvements article). A2A and S2A missile engagements are, as a result, both more dynamic and far more realistic now.</p> <p>(NOTE: These two changes have been arguably the most controversial ones during the public beta of the War Planner. The typical complaint by many players is \"My AMRAAMs are now useless unless if fire them almost at point-blank range\". Our response to this is: EXACTLY. Welcome to the real-world kinematic limitations of most AAW missiles (against agile &amp; alert targets, at least). This part of the reason that most (all?) real-life BVR kills have been achieved at significantly less-than-nominal launch ranges. Watch this BVR tactics video from F4 BMS and note how on each case the missiles are dragged-out rather than outmaneuvered. WRAs and configurable firing ranges are a thing -- and with the new percentage-based settings and NEZ they are more powerful than ever. Learn them, practice with them and use them. Or get used to becoming your adversary's chew-toy, first by the enemy AI and later by other human players as MP comes to commercial CMO.)</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Passive Coherent Location System (aka \"Passive Radar\")</p> <p>The term \"passive radar\" has grown to broadly encompass two significantly different concepts; one is ESM/SIGINT-based air-surveillance systems and the other is multistatic radars with third-party emitters. The latter is called Passive Coherent Location System, and for a general background on the technology and CONOPS see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_radar</p> <p>PCLS systems can be very capable against VLO targets (if the geometry is right), and their passive nature makes them inherently less vulnerable to SEAD attacks (although of course the emitters-of opportunity may themselves be targeted). On the other hand the geometry restrictions can be a tough taskmaster (the emitter, the receiver and the target must form a clean-LOS triangle otherwise there is no detection) and the signal propagation geometry sharply reduces the effective detection altitude. Therefore such systems are most effective when combined with other traditional active &amp; passive surveillance sets rather than operating completely on their own.</p> <p>The v488+ releases of the DB3000 database contain several \"non-detecting emitter\" platforms such as radio, TV, and cellular antennas or navigation beacons such as LORAN. It also contains a prototype PCLS vehicle that can be used in testing and as the basis for operational variants.</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Distinct mobile ground units</p> <p>In addition to modelling mobile forces as \"aimpoint facilities\" (see: https://www.warfaresims.com/?p=1159 ), it is now possible to explicitly model individual vehicles with their own customized properties such as armor, propulsion, mounts, sensors etc.</p> <p>The new-style ground units have unlocked certain brand-new capabilities, such as true amphibious vehicles (with distinct speed &amp; fuel consumption properties overwater and on land).</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Intermittent emissions</p> <p>This band-new feature allows to control the behavior of emitting sensors so they emit in intervals instead of only continuously or never.</p> <p>Alert levels</p> <p>The first thing to do is to configure a unit's interval according to the alert level. The alert level is set in the EMCON setting of any unit and affects the whole side. Below, in the \"Active Emission Interval\" we have the intermittent emission configurations for each alert levels. The side's alert level will determine which intermittent emission configuration to use:</p> <p>Emission Intervals</p> <p>Let's configure an EMCON behavior for the yellow's alert level. By default, the interval type is set to continuous, this is the usual behavior in command where an enabled sensor will emit continuously. Emission Duration is the duration in seconds of an emitting phase. Interval is the duration in seconds of a silent phase between 2 emitting phases. Interval random variation is the random duration in seconds we add to an interval. This allows unpredictability of the cycle and is particularly useful to disrupt the enemy's plan:</p> <p>The action of waking up mean that the radar will temporarily turn into continuous and ignore intermittent behavior, until time until sleep mode is elapsed. The Wake when detecting threat checkbox controls this behavior, a threat is a unit defined by the checkboxes group includes stance and includes ID. If the radar detects an unfriendly or hostile or unknown contact with any identification level, then we wake up the radar.</p> <p>If you want a unit to inherit all configuration from its parent check Use parent group parameters:</p> <p>NOTE: intermittent emission will NOT make a radar active or inactive as depicted below:</p> <p>Intermittent emission controls whether or not an active radar will be silent or emitting at a given moment.</p> <p>Custom emission intervals configuration</p> <p>If you want to use all alert level, you will need to define each interval configurations, and perhaps you want a way to override the alert level and have some units feel special and use their own rules:</p> <p>To do this, populate the Custom interval tab as you will and make sure the Use custom preset only checkbox is checked.</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Custom Environment Zones</p> <p>Multiple &amp; moving weather fronts? Check. Bend the laws of physics on a localized area? Can do. Specify carefully hand-picked weather, terrain and other environmental properties in order to test or compare sensors and other environment-dependent components? Yup. Unleash your inner nature wizard with this puppy.</p> <p>Using this new feature, you can define a zone where you can tailor the environment &amp; weather properties. This can be useful if you want a \"controlled environment\" for sensor checks, mobility &amp; damage tests etc., but can also be used as a localized \"weather override\" for scenario purposes.</p> <p>To create a CEZ, bring up the Refpoint Manager and switch to the \"Cust Env Zones\" tab. Create a zone as usual, and then click on \"Edit\". A new window should appear, in which you can define the weather &amp; environment properties:</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Palletized weapons and other stores</p> <p>This is a new capability that has been making the public rounds lately, as a result of a series of videos by AFRL on the Rapid Dragon concept. using pallets packed with guided weapons, aircraft not usually associated with frontline attack operations (such as transports) can contribute to the firepower volume allocated at enemy forces.</p> <p>As usual, there are caveats. The fact that weapons are fired from released pallets, rather than individually fired from the parent platform, means that weapon allocations must happen in batches; if a single missile in say a 12-pack is allocated, the full dozen has to be allocated either on the same target or others. (There exists of course the theoretical option of allocating only the desired amount of weapons and just sacrificing the rest of the pack, but the cost of the majority of modern weapons makes this an unlikely scenario).</p> <p>Therefore, accurately modelling this new capability (and the decisions &amp; restrictions it enforces) to Command has been a lot of work. Here's what we've come up with:</p> <p>Pallet Weapon: the Para droppable system (usually a pallet, but may also be a container etc.) containing the payload</p> <p>Palletized Weapon: the content of the pallet, the actual weapon that will be delivered</p> <p>Pallet Weapons can be fired by specific aircraft that are equipped with suitable loadouts (C-130, C-17 etc.). Several new representative loadouts have been included in the DB3000 database:</p> <p>Pallet and Weapon Allocation</p> <p>Pallet Weapons can be allocated to a target both as a Pallet or by assigning a single target for every Palletized Weapon in the aircraft Loadout. When allocating a whole Pallet, all the weapons within it will be added to the salvo, and all of them will share the same target as the Pallet:</p> <p>Single (individual) Palletized Weapons can also be allocated clicking on the relative node in the tree:</p> <p>NOTE: As mentioned, due to the nature of the weapon system the whole Pallet is dropped even when some of the weapons within are not allocated. So take care to allocate the full pack! A message will serve as a reminder in order to avoid wasting weapons:</p> <p>When the Palletized Weapons are allocated separately, the system will recognize how many Pallets are needed to fill the requested salvo quantity and will drop the appropriate amount of Pallets:</p> <p>Pallet and Weapons Behavior</p> <p>When dropped from an aircraft, the Pallet will align itself following the correct loitering pitch, and after reaching that pitch it will deploy the parachute and start to loiter. After the Pallet starts to loiter, all the allocated weapons are fired from the Pallet:</p> <p>Example with multiple Pallets:</p> <p>Pallets have one more tick up their sleave: Because they remain in coms (datalink) with their parent aircraft, you can allocate additional weapons remaining in them while they are para-dropping. Obviously this can be very useful for delayed fires against targets as the tactical situation evolves. This can be done simply by clicking on a Pallet and then allocating its hosted weapon(s) as usual:</p> <p>ZueeFXi.png (1017\u00d7609)</p> <p>Effect on WRAs</p> <p>All the WRA will now include the weapon info for the Palletized Weapons. Since the Pallet itself is just a carrier, it is not subjected to any WRA and will follow the WRA of its hosted Palletized Weapons:</p> <p>New facility category: Surface + Underground</p> <p>This new facility category represents facilities that are buried underground but also have major access from the surface in order to operate. Examples are all ballistic missile silos, some command bunkers, retractable coastal-defense turrets like ERSTA etc. These facilities are vulnerable to damage/destruction both from direct weapon impacts on their surface area and also from underground shock from near misses by penetrator weapons (or exceptionally powerful surface detonations e.g. from a multi-megaton warhead or asteroid impact).</p> <p>Significant improvements on ballistic missile kinematics</p> <p>Ballistic trajectories have been reworked from the ground up, using true Kepler equations to reflect the movement of planetary bodies. This produces true-to-life boost-phase profiles and overall trajectory parameters (this is important in order to more faithfully model the abilities &amp; limitations of BMD systems).</p> <p>Improvements in ABM DLZ calculations</p> <p>ABM systems have additional fail conditions in their DLZ evaluations compared to normal SAMs. A prime example is the intercept \"hard floor\" for exo-atmospheric systems. For instance, SM-3 cannot make intercepts under 100km in altitude (because its \"warhead\"/kill-vehicle is effectively a miniature spacecraft with a very sensitive IR seeker and no aerodynamic control, and thus cannot function within the atmosphere). This factor severely restricts the system's intercept window: If the estimated intercept point is within the atmosphere, it is already too late to shoot. This screengrab from a LM THAAD-ER promo video illustrates this well:</p> <p>In addition, the case of \"intercept will happen within weapon minimum range\" has been added as a fail condition to DLZ checks.</p> <p>Overhauled Reaction Times</p> <p>The differences in reaction times, and their effects, are now more critical than ever. All units use common-reference \"Combat System Generation\" (\"Cockpit Generation\" for aircraft) to model the modernity of their combat systems, combined with an \"Ergonomics\" value to handle intra-generation differences (the atrocious switchology on early missile-age aircraft will most definitely get you killed now). Older, WW2-era ships may take up to 5 minutes to engage a target, while Aegis cruisers fire in \\&lt;20 seconds. Cold War fighters will be beaten to the draw by modern, fifth-generation fighters. Overmatch, that ever-elusive dream, is now possible -- but beware, it goes both ways.</p> <p>Until now, the existing OODA model was hobbled by two major problems. First, most values were way too fast. Detection, targeting, and/or evasion usually took less than 20 seconds. This works for ships equipped with modern combat systems, e.g. upgraded Aegis; not so for Cold War clunkers (or, heaven forbid, a pre-WW2 battleship). Second, having to manually set OODA values per-ship meant inconsistent reaction times across combat system generations.</p> <p>For the revised model, we've added a new component to ships: the Combat System Generation (CS Gen), which can range from Gen 1 (1945-1950) to future Gen 7 (2030+). Whether you're plotting contacts on a plotting board, federated CPUs, or an integrated system -- and the age of the components making up those systems -- will have a huge effect on your ability to quickly react to and engage targets. A modern Aegis ship can spot, track, and engage a contact in about 20 seconds; for a ship with a WW2-vintage CIC, the process balloons upwards to almost five minutes. If your first detection of an incoming missile comes from your own radars, it may not be enough.</p> <p>There is an exception for small craft, which regardless of age generally have extremely fast reaction times (this is because their targeting process essentially consists of shouting at the guy on the MG to \"shoot that guy over there RIGHT NOW\"). However, this is mitigated by their comparatively less powerful sensors and weapons: being quick on the draw doesn't help much when the Mk1 Eyeball on your RHIB spots a Hellfire inbound.</p> <p>\"But wait,\" we hear you object. \"Doesn't this mean that, given an especially old ship and a modern threat, I may find myself completely helpless against an incoming missile?\" The answer is yes: those Final Countdown scenarios are going to play out very differently now. This was a major concern for naval planners during the Cold War (the development of NTDS, the US Navy's first automatic data-exchange system, was driven by classified exercises &amp; wargames in which USN ships were consistently sunk before they could react to incoming air &amp; missile strikes).</p> <p>For aircraft, the flying equivalent to the \"Combat System Generation\" for ships, the \"Cockpit Generation\" is a way for us to approximate pilot load -- and subsequently reaction times -- based on cockpit design. Aircraft can be assigned one of six cockpits: \"Basic Instruments Only,\" intended for the simplest aircraft; \"Steam Gauges, \" as for WW2-era fighters; \"Complex Steam Gauges,\" for the nightmarish mid-Cold War fighters; \"Partial Glass Cockpit,\" for transitioning aircraft of the '70s-90s; \"Glass Cockpit,\" for most modern aircraft; or finally a \"Panoramic Cockpit Display,\" representing the new single-screen touch displays coming to a fifth-generation fighter near you.</p> <p>Just as a ship is only as good as its CIC, your aircraft are only as good as their cockpits -- and whether your pilots are forced to fiddle with a forest of knobs, switches, and dials or able to glance at an easy-to-read LCD will affect their performance. Of course, the difference between aircraft cockpit generations is far less than the difference between ship CS generations, measured in seconds rather than minutes -- but in an aerial engagement, seconds do count.</p> <p>For submarines, facilities and mobile ground units, we have followed a similar path. We split submarine combat systems into six distinct \"generations,\" ranging from the early Mk1/3/4 TDC used in WW2 to the modern AN/BYG-1 and future witchcraft as featured in SSN(X). Facilities and ground units required a slightly different system: rather than using multiple \"generations\" as with ships and subs, these annexes distinguish between fixed and mobile systems and whether said system uses manual or assisted guidance. For example, radar-assisted AAA (e.g. Skyshield) will be faster to engage than a manual gun (ZSU-57); both (towed) systems will be slower at evasion than a SPAAG. The same is true for manually laid artillery vs. those with digital fire control, towed artillery vs. SPGs, etc. While less detailed than our system for ships, subs, and aircraft, we felt this was \"good enough\" for the level at which these platforms are simulated in Command. (And, of course, we always have the manual override for when we have specific platform data.)</p> <p>This is obviously is a major set of changes and potentially game-breaking for older scenarios. For this reason, the SBR tool now also includes the ability to preserve \"legacy\" OODA values when migrating scenarios to v494+ databases. For pro users, the DB Editor also offers the ability to explicitly set custom values and selectively override the generation-derived ones.</p> <p>Extra wrinkles: Ergonomics</p> <p>Not every aircraft built with steam gauges was equally difficult to fly; not every ship built in a certain decade could react with identical speed. Certain platforms gained a reputation for being especially easy to operate (the Viggen, for example, had a remarkably well-designed cockpit); others, like the Komar-class missile boat, were the bane of their operators. Much of this can be ascribed to ergonomics, the consideration (or lack thereof) of human factors in design.</p> <p>The new \"ergonomics\" field -- ranging from \"Awful\" to \"Excellent\" -- is intended to reflect these intra-generation differences, acting as a sort of OODA \"buff/debuff\" and giving the ability to adjust values to reflect upgrades, etc. without needing to take the drastic step of upgrading the combat generation.</p> <p>And, of course, you still have proficiency in the mix. Players now have an interesting mix of factors to consider:</p> <p>-- \"Tech generation,\" e.g. CS/cockpit generation: when was your platform designed/built, and what sort of tech was in play at the time? Are you working with ancient WW2 plotting boards or Aegis?</p> <p>-- Usability/ergonomics/design: are you working with beautiful, top-of-the-line COTS human interface tech or the nightmare that was mid/late-Cold War Soviet systems?</p> <p>-- Proficiency: Do you have well-trained, well-rested/motivated crews, or are you dealing with bottom-of-the-barrel conscripts?</p> <p>Those three factors will all have to play into your operational planning.</p> <p>Radar &amp; IR Stealth Modifier Improvements</p> <p>Sensor improvements come coupled with a massive overhaul of signature modifiers in the DB, which significantly improve the realism of our stealth model by drawing clearer distinctions between shaping and RAM generations.</p> <p>Prior to the v494 DB releases, we could classify an aircraft as having \"light,\" \"medium,\" or \"heavy\" stealth shaping ... and that was it. These modifiers were applied always in all aspects (no ability to define e.g. a frontal-only reduction modifier). Modeling of IR signature suppression (IRSS) techniques was even more limited.</p> <p>In v494+ we completely overhauled our existing VLO modifiers to account for shaping and RAM generations. In addition we also added several special flags to indicate the presence (or lack thereof) of certain stealthy design features. This allows us to model not only general, whole-craft stealth but also context-specific or aspect-specific features such as S-shaped intakes, exposed fan blockers, active cancellation, and stealth pylons. For example, S-shaped intakes reduce the likelihood of being detected head-on, while LO pylons reduce the impact of externally-carried stores.</p> <p>This overhaul also extends to IR modifiers. As with radar stealth, we completely rewrote our \"general\" modifiers to represent whole-aircraft IR signature suppression techniques (distributed vs. conventional fuel tanks, low-E coatings etc.) and added several additional aircraft codes to represent specific IRSS features. These codes include shielded \"anti-Strela\" exhausts, masked exhausts, heavily masked / slit-shaped exhausts, and peak temperature reduction or \"cool-air mixing\". Note that certain IRSS features come with downsides and limitations: slit-shaped exhausts, for example, will make you harder to spot but paradoxically easier to lock on to with IR weapons due to back pressure penalty; in another example, anti-Strela exhausts are most effective against someone trying to get a lock from below.</p> <p>The full list of added signature modifiers is:</p> <p>RCSS -- Active Cancellation</p> <p>RCSS -- S-Shaped Intake(s)</p> <p>RCSS -- Exposed Fan Blocker(s)</p> <p>RCSS -- Stealth Pylons</p> <p>IRSS -- Shielded Exhaust (Anti-Strela)</p> <p>IRSS -- Masked Exhaust</p> <p>IRSS -- Heavily Masked / Slit-Shaped Exhaust</p> <p>IRSS -- Peak Temp Reduction (Cool-Air Mix)</p> <p>We've backfilled all LO/VLO aircraft in both DBs with these features as best as we could determine. (Naturally, in many cases and especially with contemporary stealth fighters, exact details are sometimes hard to come by.) These changes mean that various LO/VLO aircraft are now much harder (or easier) to detect than you may be used to. We have solid confidence in the results; comparisons with known real-world RCS &amp; IR data yield accurate numbers. However, we're also open to feedback: expect tweaks in future DB releases as we hone the new values. Pro users can of course manually input their precise classified figures as before.</p> <p>IR &amp; Visual Sensor Improvements</p> <p>Closely related to the above, this was initially presented and discussed in the professional edition context (see presentation side to the right) but applies equally to the commercial edition.</p> <p>IRSTs and high-mag cameras are no longer near-magical counter-VLO sensors. They may still be your best bet for detection, but you won't be volume-scanning for stealth fighters at &gt;100nm anymore. (You can still spot/track them pretty far enough IF something/someone else first cues you there). Abhirup Sengupta broadly explains the tech background behind this limitation well in this Quora post.</p> <p>The relevant sensors now have a dual value in the search range listing in the DB value, to make it more explicit where their volume search extends to. For example, this listing for the PIRATE IRST system on RAF's Typhoon Tranche 3:</p> <p>...indicates that the system can perform un-cued volume search out to 20nm, but can track already-detected targets out to 100nm (both cases under ideal conditions).</p> <p>Visual and IR checks are now also susceptible to look-down clutter. For example, it is easier for an IRST (or the plain Mk1 Eyeball) to pick out an aircraft over the horizon line than against the surface background.</p> <p>Degree-Definable Sensor Arcs and Vertical Scan Limits</p> <p>This is a seemingly small but important improvement to our sensor modelling: at last, sensor arcs can optionally be defined in degrees, rather than just in \"pie wedge\" set sectors. We've also implemented vertical sensor arcs, which were especially important during the Cold War. Older air-to-air radars were often limited to a small chunk of vertical space (20 degrees or so), which meant that fighters would struggle to detect aircraft far below or above them. For air planners, this meant \"Low CAPs\" and \"High CAPs\" were necessary. Soon you too will have to consider altitude in your CAP coverage.</p> <p>(Note that current DBs do not have vertical sensor arc data backfilled, so this won't have an immediate effect on gameplay until we can do a bit more research. Expect to see an RFI in the public GitHub for arcs and scan limits.)</p> <p>Parallelized attack salvo calculations</p> <p>The creation of attack salvos is now largely run in parallel instead of sequentially.</p> <p>Some background to this: Until now, the creation of attack salvos was done purely sequentially. Unit-1 examines if it can attack (both doctrinally and physically) a contact; if yes, it creates a new salvo or adds its weapon(s) to an existing one for the same target with same weapon ID. Then Unit-2 does the same, etc. etc. until a suitable salvo for the given target is filled to capacity. This presents a number of issues:</p> <p>Because of the sequential nature, a potential \"Unit-3\" which perhaps is better located to attack the same target, or perhaps has a more suitable weapon for it, may not be considered at all (if a suitable salvo for the given target is filled-to-capacity by previous units). This can lead to problematic situations like this.</p> <p>Again because of the sequential calculation, this process does not exploit multiple CPU cores and can significantly slow down a pulse execution in a large/busy scenario.</p> <p>Units now perform the salvo evaluations in their own individual threads and submit \"firing proposals\" to their side. The parent side groups firing proposals per-target and selects the most promising one, based on criteria that depend on the nature of the target (e.g. for aerospace targets an important factor is time-to-impact). Once selected, the salvos are executed as usual.</p> <p>Weather effects for surface ship speed</p> <p>This is an optional new feature. When enabled, deteriorating weather conditions (and especially increasing sea state) has an adverse impact on the maximum speed that ships can travel. This effect is particularly acute on small-displacement ships. Depending on sea state and ship size, a ship may be forced to run at 3/4, half, 1/4 speed or even heave (effectively remain stationary).</p> <p>The information about the weather-related limitation is shown in various ways:</p> <p>On the ship datablock</p> <p>On the Unit Status panel</p> <p>On the throttle/altitude window</p> <p>Because this feature can potentially unbalance existing scenarios, it is optional (can be toggled on the \"Scenario Realism Features\" window) and is \"ON\" by default when making a new scenario, and \"OFF\" by default when loading an existing scenario.</p> <p>Aircraft maximum airborne endurance</p> <p>This fixes the \"aircraft may stay up indefinitely by multiple A2A-refuellings\" realism flaw. Aircraft are now limited in their total airborne endurance depending on their size, type and crew complement. The information about current airborne total time and maximum endurance is listed on the fuel panel and is color-coded for at-a-glance evaluation (dark red is bad). If an aircraft reaches it max endurance limit, it enters an \"RTB -- Exhaustion\" state, turns straight for its home base and will refuse any manual orders to change course or engage in any other activity.</p> <p>Other simulation bits and pieces</p> <p>-- Added new ASuW doctrine option: \"Use missile waypoints\" (NO by default). When set to Yes, ASuW missile shooters will use the missile's waypoint/dogleg capability (if present and if the range allows it). If set to No, ASuW missile shots will always go \"straight in\" (for old-timers, this is the default CMANO pre-v1.10 behavior).</p> <p>-- Non-ABM-optimized AAW missiles (e.g. Stunner) use a direct-flight profile when engaging ballistic targets (even if they have a lofting/cruise altitude set in the DB)</p> <p>-- An AAW missile's attitude control type is now taken into account when determining Ph reduction due to reduced terminal energy:</p> <p>Interceptors with non-aerodynamic control (e.g. SM3, THAAD) have no reduction at all</p> <p>Interceptors with aerodynamic-only control (i.e. most SAMs) have the as-standard reduction</p> <p>Interceptors with combined aero &amp; non-aero control (e.g. Aster 15/30, 9M96) halve their Ph reduction (the non-aero control diminishes the negative effect of low terminal energy on maneuverability)</p> <p>-- Optional speed improvement: Do not share-and-deduplicate contact messages between allied sides.</p> <p>HOW TO ENABLE: On Command.ini, under the category [Game Preferences], add this: \"DedupAlliedMessages = False\"</p> <p>PROS: In scenarios with numerous sides allied to each other, this can provide a significant boost to sim performance.</p> <p>CONS: When this is enabled, sides do not receive contact-related messages (new contact, contact status change, contact lost etc.) from their allied sides. NOTE: The contact data itself is shared as always, it's only the log-messages that are not shared. This may or may not be a significant hindrance depending on your gameplay style.</p> <p>-- Ships &amp; submarines now attempt to evade incoming torpedoes more realistically, following these guidelines. Submarines will additionally alter their depth to avoid the torpedo(es) if appropriate.</p> <p>-- Added new sonar sub-type: Vertical Flank Array (DB v494+ required). These have been present in some Russian sub classes for a while, and are now backfitted on the Ohio class and earmarked for future US SSNs. They provide improved tracking capability (can establish a high-quality TMA track sooner).</p> <p>-- Expendable UAVs (and weapons/decoys) can now have their plotted course programmable in throttle &amp; altitude</p> <p>-- Surface targets are now affected also by underground explosions, though not nearly as much as underground facilities (they receive much less of the transmitted shock). This makes it possible to damage/destroy buildings through near misses by penetrator weapons.</p> <p>-- New simulation feature: Certain weapons occupy their launcher while they are enroute (e.g. most wire-guided torpedoes &amp; ATGMs). The mount cannot be reloaded before the weapon is destroyed one way or another. (Requires DBs v489+)</p> <p>-- ADDED: RWR detection of SARH/TVM illumination auto-generates an (incoming) missile contact, even if the missile itself has not yet been detected yet. This provides realistic ahead-warning (and thus evasion opportunity) to the targeted aircraft.</p> <p>-- New simulation feature: Daisy Chain-type weapon datalinks (DB v489+ required). This allows weapons to communicate directly with each other instead of being slaved to a datalink platform.</p> <p>-- The AI can now employ Mobile Air Decoys (MALD/TALD) (DB v489+ required).</p> <p>-- Support missions can now be created without a ref point (with a visual warning). Example use: Turn on ground based radars without having to turn them on the side-level or individually.</p> <p>-- AI improvement in wingman logic: Distances when evaluating contacts is measured from the group LEAD (not from itself), so the wingman will not chain-investigate away from lead. Also, wingmen do not investigate contacts alone if some other aircraft in the same mission is checking it. So if there are more unknowns than flights, wingmen may start breaking off to investigate them when they are in weapons range of their lead, otherwise they will not.</p> <p>-- Dual-seeker ARMs (e.g. AARGM) can now be fired (non-BOL) against non-emitting targets</p> <p>-- Relaxed the \"have reached formation station\" check threshold for aircraft (makes them less eager to throttle up to get to station)</p> <p>-- Ship attack AI tweak: When attacking with a contact bomb (i.e. saboteur or kamikaze), if possible, use flank throttle to minimize the target's reaction window.</p> <p>-- The visual &amp; IR signature modifiers of in-flight missiles have been tweaked so that they are picked up at shorter ranges. This prevents unrealistic early detection of incoming missiles and thus too-effective maneuvering against them.</p> <p>-- Aircraft AI tweak: When in normal loiter mode (no mission flight or plotted course), wingmen ignore their formation station and just stick close to the leader</p> <p>-- Added: Fuel resupply and rearm for submarines</p> <p>-- Tweaks to sonar cavitation model:</p> <p>Cavitation is now dependent on desired speed (i.e. screw turn rate) rather than current vessel speed</p> <p>The noise boost from the onset of cavitation is now gradual (instead of all or nothing), and its magnitude depends on how much above the cavitation threshold the desired speed is</p> <p>-- Aircraft will now pitch up/down as necessary if weapon release is blocked by vertical boresight limits</p> <p>-- When undetected units fire gun/missile weapons, their visual signature blooms temporarily and they are susceptible to detection.</p> <p>-- BOL-fired torpedoes will snake if they are able to</p> <p>-- Added new navigation doctrine option: \"Direct path\" for ground units. This causes land units to head straight towards their destination without any pathfinding considerations.</p> <p>-- Added: Mine-Clearing mission can now also use \"repeatable loop\" movement style (so e.g. use explicit sweeping lanes)</p> <p>-- MIRVs are now released from ballistic missiles in sequence, one every 5 seconds (instead of all together)</p> <p>-- ARMs are less effective against low-band emitters (increased chance of a miss)</p> <p>-- Active sensors on aircraft are temporarily de-activated when approaching a target tanker for refueling (this is a safety measure to avoid igniting the tanker's fuel).</p> <p>-- ALARM parachute loiter capability added (this requires DB3000 v489+)</p> <p>-- Vehicles now use cargo load/unload time calculation similar to aircraft</p> <p>-- Cargo transfers now attempt to keep grouped units (that are stored in cargo) together when possible.</p> <p>-- Amphibious vehicles assigned to an active mission but stored in cargo will be checked against available docking facilities on their host unit. If available, they will self-unload into the docking facility. This is currently checked every 30 seconds though only one unit can self-unload per check. Amphibious vehicles cannot use davit type docking facilities.</p> <p>-- Docked amphibious vehicles that are assigned to an active mission will launch automatically if they're in range of the mission area. This is the same behavior as boats currently perform for cargo missions, but amphibious vehicles auto-launch for all mission types.</p> <p>-- Ground Units can now perform cargo missions.</p> <p>-- Added \"X days underway\" tracking value for subs (example).</p> <p>-- Tweak to radar clutter logics: AESAs which refresh/revisit existing target tracks can narrow their beams and effectively cancel-out clutter altogether. This does NOT apply to volume-search scan against not-yet-detected targets.</p> <p>-- Implemented distinct horizon propagation values for different sensor types. Typical factors are 1.23, 1.5, and 1.06 for radar, ESM, and EO/IR respectively. These parameters are defined in the \"Electronic Warfare and Radar Systems Engineering Handbook\".</p> <p>Weapon Release Authorization (WRA)</p> <p>Command 1.07 adds a Weapon Release Authorization (WRA) tab to the Doctrine window. The WRA lists all weapons for the current side, mission, group or unit. To change the WRA for a weapon, press the (+) to expand the target list, and update the desired setting. Players and scenario designers can configure the number of weapons to use against a target and also the number of shooters that may participate in a salvo. Furthermore, the 'automatic firing range' of weapon systems can be capped so that the Artificial Intelligence (AI) won't automatically fire the weapon at certain target types beyond a given range. And lastly, each weapon system's self-defence behaviour can be configured in detail.</p> <p>Weapon quantities</p> <p>The WRA has two levels of targets: 'Unknown/Unspecified' and 'Specific' types. The first level is made up of 'Unknown Type' and 'Unspecified' target types, which are highlighted in bold text and used before and after a target has been identified. I.e. a blip on the screen uses 'Unknown Type' settings, and once identified as an aircraft or guided weapon the 'Unspecified' settings are used.</p> <p>The WRA allows further refinement of the weapon allocations by specific target types. For example, the WRA can be configured to fire two missiles at a target identified as a MiG-29s and one missile at a Tu-95. Click on the screenshot to the right for an example. Here, the RIM-66M-5 SM-2MR Blk IIIB SAM will be fired in pairs against 4th and 5th generation fighters and supersonic missiles, and singly against all other target types. It should be noted that in this screenshot, most settings are inherited from side level since they have not been configured locally, while some specific aircraft types have not been configured at all and inherit from the 'Unspecified' settings.</p> <p>The WRA settings are inherited the same way as doctrine and EMCON are. The WRA can be configured at side, mission, group or unit level, and inherit settings from higher levels if not set at the current level. This makes the WRA very flexible, i.e. aircraft flying Mission A may be set up to fire 2 weapons at a given target, while all other units (from side level via missions and groups down to unit level) fire 4 of the given weapon at the same type of target.</p> <p>When firing a SM-2MR Blk IIIB against a contact identified as a MiG-29, the simulator will first check the WRA setting for a 4th Generation Fighter/Attack aircraft from unit level via group and mission to side level. If not defined at any of these levels, the simulator will check the 'Unspecified' category from unit to side level. The 'Unspecified' target type is always specified at side level, and is the last place the WRA looks.</p> <p>In addition to specifying the exact number of weapons to fire, anti-ship and land-attack weapons may also rely on the target's 'Missile Defence' value to automatically determine the number of weapons to fire depending on the target's defensive capabilities. See screenshot to the right for an example. The 'Missile Defence' value can be found in the Database Viewer (DB Viewer) for ships and facilities, and gives an indication on the number of Harpoon / SLAM / Maverick missiles needed to destroy the unit. The weapon may also be configured to use multiples of the 'Missile Defence' value. For instance, a less powerful weapon may be configured to use twice as many weapons, where as high-performance weapons like the AS-4 Kitchen or SS-N-19 Shipwreck are configured to use 1/4th the 'Missile Defence' value. In other words, a ship that is estimated to take 16x Harpoon missiles to sink will only have 4x AS-4s fired at it.</p> <p>The WRA allows more refined 'Weapon Control Status' (WCS) than the FREE / TIGHT / HOLD settings in the Doctrine tab. Granted the WCS is set to FREE or TIGHT, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be excluded from automatically firing at certain targets to prevent employment of heavy anti-ship missiles against tiny boats that are best dealt with using other weapons such as guns. In the above screenshot the Harpoon missile has been configured to not be used against 0-500 ton vessels such as torpedo boats, smaller minehunters, open boats, tugs, fishing boats, small landing craft, etc. However the weapon will be used against 0-500 ton missile boats. Please note that this only applies if the target has been positively identified as a 0-500 ton boat. Otherwise, the AI will use the 'Unknown Type' settings and fire two weapons.</p> <p>Number of shooters</p> <p>In addition to limiting the number of weapons to fire, the number of shooters to participate in a salvo can be configured in the WRA. Typically, air targets will only have one unit firing at a time to avoid taking up more channels-of-fire than needed. Surface targets may have more shooters, for instance two ships participating with 8x Harpoon missiles each in a 16-round salvo against a Sovremenny DDG. Shooters will seek to fire all weapons in a salvo by themselves, and will only ask other units to join if there are not enough weapons available on the first unit.</p> <p>Automatic Firing Range</p> <p>In addition to control whether or not a weapon can be automatically fired by the Artificial Intelligence (AI), and preventing a weapon to automatically fire depending on target type, the WRA also allows the player and scenario designers to limit automatic fire by target range. For instance, a 80nm range weapon may be limited to automatic fire at 30nm. The player will of course be able to allocate weapons manually out to full weapons range.</p> <p>A typical example would be to reduce the firing-range of SA-5 Gammon SAMs to prevent them from interfering with fighters on Combat Air Patrol (CAP). I.e. by using a 50nm range limitation. Or preventing use of the new 160nm-range SM-6 SAM against difficult targets at ranges beyond 50nm.</p> <p>Self Defence</p> <p>Normally, only one friendly unit engages an enemy contact at a time. However, in many cases it would make sense for units to defend themselves when they feel threatened, even when other units are currently firing at the contact. For example, a pair of MiG-23s are closing on a bogey at nearly 2000 knots. Seconds before reaching firing parameters for an AA-7 Apex shot, a SA-5 Gammon site launches a salvo. If the MiG-23s wait for the SA-5s to reach the target before shooting, they will already have merged with the contact and the dogfight begun. To prevent this from happening, it is possible to configure the Self-Defence Range in the WRA. Typically, the self-defence range for the AA-7 is 5nm. This means any MiG-23 that gets within 5nm will launch AA-7s regardless of how many weapons have been allocated to this bogey by other units.</p> <p>Another example would be a Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) under attack. The escorts do a great job picking off incoming anti-ship missiles with SM-2 SAMs. But once a leaker gets within 5nm of the carrier, the ship will fire a salvo of Sea Sparrows or RAM in self-defence regardless of whether the anti-ship missile currently has SAMs from any of the escorts targeted at it.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>In order to control automatic use of weapons in Command: Modern Air / Naval Operations, first set the 'Weapon Control Status' (WCS) in the Doctrine window to FREE / TIGHT / HOLD. When set to FREE or TIGHT, weapon employment can be further refined by target types and the number of weapons to be fired in the 'Weapons per Salvo' column in the Weapon Release Authorization (WRA) tab. The firing range can be limited in the 'Automatic Firing Range' column and the AI can also be prevented from firing the weapon in this column. Finally, the 'Self Defence' column allows a unit to fire the weapon regardless of whether the target being dealt with by another unit.</p> <p>Please note that the decision of whether or not to shoot, and the number of weapons to fire, is decided the instance the simulator generates the weapon salvo. It uses what is currently known about the target to determine what target type settings to use. Two incoming anti-ship missiles may be of 'Unknown Type' and 'Supersonic Sea Skimming' respectively, and may trigger very different behaviour. So make sure that the target types are configured correctly for all target identification levels, from Unknown and Unspecified target types to Specified target type.</p> <p>It should be noted that guns are normally set up to automatically fire at anything that comes within range. Default settings allows the weapon to be used against any legal target type, using continuous fire, an unlimited number of firing units to participate per target, employment out to max range, and self-defence out to max range. This means that guns will always fire even when the target is under attack by other weapons. To limit gun usage, make sure to alter the 'Self Defence' range in addition to any other custom modifications. Nerf Wars: On downgrading Russian systems &amp; units in Command</p> <p>Nerf Wars: On downgrading Russian systems &amp; units in Command</p> <p>So, ever since it became clear that Russian combat performance in Ukraine has been \"less than stellar\", there has been a persistent request in many corners of the web towards the Command dev team. The request can be summed up as:</p> <p>\"So, when are you guys going to nerf Russian equipment in Command's database, to match what we are seeing in Ukraine? It seems it is performing well below official specs.\"</p> <p>(Oxford Dictionary: \"to nerf\": (of a video game developer) reduce the power of (a character, weapon, etc.) in a new instalment or update of a video game.)</p> <p>A naval-oriented variant of this comment is: \"I tried simulating the attack on the cruiser Moskva, and I just couldn't sink it as happened it real life. So CMO is probably talking up Russian hardware.\"</p> <p>Now, there is a short and direct answer to both these claims, but we have been advised not to print it here. So let's go into the more elaborate and slightly more polite version instead.</p> <p>Command, by default (i.e.. stock DB values) represents Russian systems (and all other nation's systems) as they are meant to be used, by trained crews employing them according to their design doctrine. Shortly after the Ukraine conflict got going for real, a US general remarked that \"Russian hardware works pretty well... when used by Ukrainians\".</p> <p>(As a quick example of this, Carlo Kopp had written an unusually insightful analysis on what happens when Russian SAMs get used correctly, and also what happens when they are not. Favorite quote: \"The Syrians used mobile missiles in a fixed configuration; they put the radars in the valley instead of the hills because they didn't want to dig latrines --- seriously.\")</p> <p>At the same time, Command also recognizes that combat is not a sterile hardware contest, and provides a lot of \"soft factor\" options (crew proficiency settings, reaction times, doctrine settings, EMCON, ROE etc.) to offer the ability to represent sub-optimal usage of said hardware. You can have two different units use exactly the same hardware with vastly different effectiveness and survivability (our favorite reference example is Iraqi 1991 SA-6 battery vs. Serbian 1999 SA-6 battery).</p> <p>An example list of the factors you can edit:</p> <p>Proficiency levels, both side-wide and per-unit</p> <p>Reaction times (OODA loop values)</p> <p>Doctrine settings</p> <p>Rules of Engagement</p> <p>EMCON settings</p> <p>WRA settings (i.e.. firing doctrine)</p> <p>Per-component equipment failure</p> <p>That very last aspect is particularly important in light of what has been recently learned WRT the system readiness on the Moskva. According to the leaked readiness report (standard caveat for CYA-shaped leaks), both the central SA-N-6 fire control radar and the short-range SA-N-4 systems were effectively disabled due to equipment malfunction and were waiting for replacements. In addition both the main guns as well as the main air-search radar were also inoperative. In other words, the Moskva was sent to an active warzone almost naked against air/missile attack.</p> <p>Can this be faithfully reproduced in Command? Absolutely.</p> <p>Can other factors, such as apparently poor crew proficiency which led to both poor reaction times and also abysmal damage control, also be modelled? Also yes, very easily so.</p> <p>So why then do some CMO users out there find it so hard to reproduce results like the Moskva sinking? (Or the Saki airbase strike, or S-300/400 batteries not being omnipotent, or UAVs apparently roaming at will, or...)</p> <p>TOUGH LOVE WARNING: Because some people's idea of \"testing something in the scenario editor\" is to quickly plop down a few units here and there, in their stock-DB setups, give them free fire reign against each other, and call it a day. No customization for soft factors, component status or any of the other real-world aspects that directly impact the end result.</p> <p>Thankfully, some players are disciplined enough to do it right. Here is an example, soon after the actual sinking itself when info was still scarce. (This of course is far from \"the last word\" on the subject. SMEs are still debating e.g. how the Sheffield went down after a single Exocet hit while the Stark survived two of them. Hell, even WW2 events are still up for analysis. It's a safe bet that the Moskva sinking will be endlessly discussed by our grandchildren.)</p> <p>It is tempting indeed, to embed the soft-factor issues directly into the DB entries themselves, so that when you spawn a Russian unit on the virtual battlefield, it's in a sorry condition out-of-the-box, ready to be clobbered. The price you pay for this expedient approach becomes obvious only later, when you realize that not only you lost the ability to clearly separate man (and context/circumstances) from machine, but you also railroaded yourself intellectually into believing that this Russian unit will always behave like this.</p> <p>Does this matter? Let us consider, for instance, an Israeli staff sergeant nerfing Egyptian tanks in a wargame just prior to Yom Kippur in 1973 \"because they were such pushovers just a few years back\". Did this specific example happen? Maybe, maybe not; but we know for a fact that the Israeli military establishment grossly underestimated Egyptian &amp; Syrian forces because of their lightning successes in 1967 (they essentially nerfed them in their mental \"databases\"), and that plenty of Israeli soldiers paid for that intellectual myopia with their lives. Is this a mistake we want (or can afford) to repeat?</p> <p>Such a radical shift in combat effectiveness with identical/similar hardware does not happen just between conflicts, but also within the span of a conflict itself. Returning to Ukraine for an example, in the early days of the \"rush for Kiev\" we observed a lot of Russian SHORADS batteries getting bombed by aircraft while completely inoperative. As it turns out, apparently the rapid speed at which these elements were forced to move (to screen the assault forces) prevented them from properly screening/leap-frogging each other and thus actually operating as they are designed and supposed to do. When later these very same systems were properly echeloned with the forces they covered during the Russian withdrawal to Donbass (and also undeniably as the hard lessons of the first weeks were distilled to the surviving operators), their effectiveness and survivability were restored to expected levels. (And then the Ukrainians introduced HARMs in the theater... but that's another story)</p> <p>How can you represent such drastic differences in effectiveness in the very same unit, if the soft-factors are embedded in the database entry? Short answer: You can't.</p> <p>(Longer answer: You can cheat/hack your way into it by having multiple entries in the DB, each representing different competence levels and equipment maintenance. It's a very hacky solution, a maintenance nightmare, and again you are mixing up man, machine and context. We sometimes were forced to do something like this back in the computer-Harpoon days, simply because Harpoon had absolutely no soft factors. Nowadays we can and must do better.)</p> <p>So, to recap: We would be doing a grave disservice to both our commercial players and especially pro customers by directly embedding soft factors into the DB just so that Joe Player can get a realistically-degraded Moskva out of the box. Platforms and systems in the DB are spawned in pristine condition and (by default) are assumed to be crewed competently: This is not a design oversight, but a conscious and carefully-considered decision. Players can then modify the platforms themselves, turning them into anything from decrepit spank-targets all the way to invincible fortresses, and shape the context of the virtual environment in their favor or against them, in order to either recreate historical situations or explore hypotheticals of past, present or future. But in every case, it's something that they will have to roll up their sleeves and do themselves. To quote Norm Koger from two decades ago: \"Word processors ask a lot of those who would use them to create stories\".</p> <p>The v1.03 Command update</p> <p>Major improvements to sonar model. Based on an ongoing discussion of existing flaws in the sonar model (see here for the tech background) with various SMEs both on and off the forum, we have renovated many aspects of the sonar model in order to improve its real-world fidelity. A brief summary of the changes included:</p> <p>-- The thermocline layer is generally weaker then before for a given location, and completely stops being effective at 70+ degrees north or south latitude.</p> <p>-- The minimum bottom depth necessary to achieve converge zone (CZ) propagation is sharply increased per given location, and is no longer static but dependent on latitude. CZs are now also impossible at 70+ degrees north or south latitude.</p> <p>-- Most under-layer sonars (SOSUS/SURTASS excluded) lose the 2x detection range bonus afforded by the deep sound channel. This sharply reduces the in-DSC detection ranges of VDS &amp; towed arrays.</p> <p>Combined, these changes have the effect of making submarines at great depth more difficult to detect with towed arrays or VDS, and shifting the emphasis more to direct-path detections at the expense of CZs.</p> <p>Select IRST/FLIR systems can now produce AAW fire control-grade data, allowing EMCON-silent engagements with AMRAAM-class weapons (background discussion here ). Note that the fire-control data generated by advanced IRSTs can be used not only for direct onboard shooting (e.g. F-18E uses IRST-21 to silently shoot AMRAAMs at target) but it can also be distributed to other platforms via CEC (e.g. F-18E silently tracks target, hands off to CEC-equipped ship which silently shoots SM-6 at target).</p> <p>NOTE: Scenarios will need to be made/rebuilt in DB3000 v488+ in order to use this feature. These are the sensors in DB3000 v488 that have this ability.</p> <p>Visual and IR sensors are now also susceptible to look-down clutter. For example it is easier for an IRST (or the plain Mk1 Eyeball) to pick out an aircraft over the horizon line than against the surface background. This provides an extra incentive to \"go low\", even for VLO aircraft, and makes terrain-hugging cruise missiles even harder to spot.</p> <p>Datalink + TARH AAW missiles (e.g. AMRAAM, SM-6 etc.) can now go active without immediately going autonomous. This allows such missiles to be guided with greater precision &amp; reliability against VLO targets or in strong OECM environment. The datalink is cut instead only when the missile acquires the target (or impacts on it, still under positive control from the link provider.</p> <p>Various improvements in ballistic missile &amp; BMD modeling, including fixing the simulation slowdown caused by ABM DLZ calculations.</p> <p>Numerous smaller changes and quality-of-life additions. As a quick example, it is now much easier to visually spot when a side/group/unit's doctrine &amp; ROE settings are overridden at a higher (parent) or lower (children) level, as they are now displayed in a different color when they do. Also as a popular request, the LOS-tool now supports altitude input in feet in addition to meters.</p> <p>The v488 release of the DB3000 database, incorporating countless player requests and new additions as well as numerous tweaks and fixes. You can view the complete DB changelog here.</p> <p>Command: Modern Operations -- The new simulation &amp; editor features https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=4990</p> <p>We have already covered the massive UI/UX changes and improvements in CMO in a previous two -- parter piece. We also saw the significant improvements in ground operations. But at the end of the day, Command's beating heart remains an elaborate simulation engine of air, naval, strategic and joint operations at the tactical and operational/theater level, together with a powerful editor for manipulating and creating with it. So let us take a look at some of the major new features in this area.</p> <p>Turbo-charged for your pleasure</p> <p>One of the most immediately noticeable features, especially when running large or elaborate scenarios, is the jump in performance. Command now offers both greater absolute speed in simulation execution (i.e. reduced \"pulse time\" as displayed when the \"Show Diagnostics\" option is enabled) as well as significantly increased CPU utilization, as a result of improved parallelism. (As an example of the latter, on a recent trial run of \"Northern Fury #9: Hold the line\", CPU load was observed fluctuating between 65%-75% on a Core i7-6700 system. This may vary across different systems, of course). Maximum practical unit count has also increased thanks to better memory management, with the result that even more massive scenarios are now feasible.</p> <p>Until the COWs come home: Comms disruption, aircraft damage &amp; new weapons</p> <p>As we previously mentioned, it was decided to merge the previously DLC-locked features of \"Chains Of War\" to the core simulation available with Command. This allow both scenario authors and players to make extensive use of these features without any licensing concerns. We've covered these features extensively before, and we included cargo, amphibious and airdrop operations on our previous article on ground warfare, so here is a short summary of the others:</p> <p>Comms disruption explores the different &amp; numerous ways that a unit can be isolated from its parent side's communications grid, and the repercussions of \"going offline\" (spoiler: none of them are pleasant). This feature has been used very successfully on COW, Shifting Sands and The Silent Service, and now it can be used on any scenario. One of the post-launch improvements of this feature is that when a unit re-joins the comms grid, the UI provides much more fine-grained feedback on what type of information was updated for a contact (if any), and skips mentioning contact merges that produce no new info. Ready to feel a cold sweat as your units abruptly go out of visibility and out of your control?</p> <p>Detailed aircraft damage is arguably the most popular feature of the bunch, enabling a much more fine-grained level of damage &amp; attrition on aircraft than classic CMANO's \"kill on first hit\" paradigm. Since its original introduction, this feature has been significantly enriched with feedback from both commercial &amp; professional users.</p> <p>Advanced weapon types: High-energy lasers, railguns &amp; HVPs, and tactical EMPs are now available at your disposal, to mindlessly include in the next Transformers flick use in all scenarios addressing the challenges of warfare in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Alone and unafraid: Realistic submarine comms</p> <p>One of the benefits of absorbing the COW features is that now we can freely use them as building blocks for additional functionality, inserting features &amp; mechanics that would previously require some non-trivial Lua elbow grease. Realistic sub comms are one such example.</p> <p>When this feature is enabled, submarines who go below 40m depth go off the communications grid. As in other cases of comms disruption, they are no longer under direct player control, and only their last reported location is available (this BTW means that sending them deep without first tasking them with a mission may be pointless, since they will simply sit there). The player can, at any time, send a \"bell-ringer\" ELF signal to a no-comms submarine to recall it to re-establish comms (right-click on sub icon, click on \"Summon to re-establish comms\"). The sub will attempt to rise to shallow depth to rejoin (this may not be immediate, as it will try to evade nearby hostiles). Once it rejoins, the sub will share its contact updates with its parent side.</p> <p>Never stray from the path</p> <p>One of the more persistent problem of CMANO's navigation AI was that its pathfinder was binary-based: Either a spot was passable by a unit, or it was not. This resulted in a tendency in units to aggressively cut corners in their plotted paths in order to travel to their destination as efficiently as possible, sometimes coming dangerously close to shore or other obstacles. This can result in some unintended \"beach surfing\", as this example demonstrates:</p> <p>In this case, the Freedom is placed in the mouth of the Hormuz straits and ordered to travel inside the Persian Gulf. It plots an efficient path --- too efficient, as it nearly clips the shoreline at Khasab. There is a possibility that the ship may get stuck on the shore, if left unattended. Ships generally don't navigate this way if they can help it.</p> <p>To address this issue, we implemented a new cost-based pathfinder that evaluates a location's suitability based on a number of different factors. In the case of ships, a primary concern is local depth and proximity to terrain; generally large ships tend to prefer to maximize both, while smaller ships are somewhat more freewheeling. Using this new logic, ships are now able to plot much more realistic (and gameplay-friendly) courses, as the very same example played out in CMO demonstrates:</p> <p>Stay in formation</p> <p>This has been a popular request, which we are finally happy to oblige: The formation editor can now also been used to define and edit aircraft formations. It sounds like a simple change, but in reality we had to go through extensive reviews of the mission AI logics to make sure that this did not interfere with aircraft assembly &amp; grouping logics (in some places it did, and we had to make adjustments). But we think it's worth it, and you will probably agree: This opens up new opportunities for formation tactics and optimum placement &amp; distribution of air assets in a group, both for regular transit or surveillance as well as combat.</p> <p>A patrol of four MiG-31B sweeps over the sea north of Murmansk. The group is in loose line abreast formation, to widen the search area. Lead and the nearest wingman are already in position, while the two outer members race to catch up to their stations.</p> <p>I like the way you move (and think)</p> <p>Various tweaks &amp; improvements have been applied to the kinematics models &amp; AI routines, with a strong emphasis on aircraft and missiles. Among other items:</p> <p>Numerous tweaks to aircraft flight model, specifically for \"combat\" conditions. For example, aircraft no longer \"wiggle\" between headings as they must first roll towards the turn direction before committing to a turn. This in turn makes inherent roll-rate more important to close air combat maneuvers (This is easier to observe in the Tacview window).</p> <p>Helicopter diving rates have been reduced (they were previously dropping like a stone)</p> <p>Surface- and underwater-launched missiles now use the same improved pitch kinematics as air-launched missiles, resulting is more realistic trajectories.</p> <p>Lofted AAW missiles now begin their terminal dive earlier, to avoid a too-steep approach to the target.</p> <p>Air combat AI improvement: Aircraft now consider approaching fighters/interceptors as imminent threat, not just missiles. This helps AI-controlled aircraft perform more proactive evasive maneuvers against fighters about to perform gun attacks on them (e.g. MiG-17 vs F-105).</p> <p>Significant change in unit AI logic: The \"evaluate targets\" and \"evaluate threats\" logics are now not performed on every sim pulse, but instead on regular intervals dictated by the OODA-Targeting (modified by crew proficiency) and OODA-Evasion values respectively. Therefore these two OODA values, combined with crew proficiency, become even more critical to a unit's effectiveness and survivability.</p> <p>Feeling the strain: Aircrew G-tolerance</p> <p>If you have ever closely watched a dogfight in CMANO, one of the things that may seem odd if you are familiar with real-world ACM is the seemingly iron-man constitution of the virtual fighter pilots; they seem to be constantly engaging in turns, climbs and dives as tight as their airframes will allow them, without regard for their own fatigue from the continuous high-G acceleration loads. This isn't how close air combat works in real life; even the best pilots need a breather between aggressive maneuvering in order to allow their bodies to recover, otherwise they become more dangerous to themselves and their side than to the enemy (yes UCAV fanboys, you can laugh now). So we set out to model this nuance in CMO.</p> <p>When an aircraft is considered to be performing \"combat maneuvers\", an extra UI element is shown on unit status panel:</p> <p>This represents the crew's tolerance to hard maneuvering. The longer the aircraft is continuously pulling a hard turn, the more this buffer fills up. (Getting out of a hard maneuver, e.g. reversing a turn, reduces this strain and allows recovering. This is one of the reasons that scissors are a popular practice in RL dogfights.)</p> <p>Once the tolerance is exhausted, the crew begin suffering G-LOC and have to significantly relax the turn (this is easier to notice in Tacview, as the aircraft wing bank visibly changes, but you should also observe a noticeably larger turn radius on the map's top-down view as well), while regaining their senses and control of the aircraft. Of course the aircraft is particularly more vulnerable during this recovery period, which makes cooperative tactics and mutual support all the more important. The maximum tolerance level depends on aircrew proficiency, so experienced pilots get one more significant advantage against greener adversaries (Ed: Like they need one more...).</p> <p>Radar frequency agility</p> <p>Not all radars are created equal. One particular feature that became quite important during the Cold War for radar performance against jamming and other countermeasures was its ability to \"frequency hop\", i.e. shift its operating frequency to a different value within its feasible operating range. CMO now models this, and two particular operational benefits of this ability:</p> <p>Frequency-agile radars are significantly harder to noise-jam, as they can shift to a new frequency once their existing one gets flooded with static. The jammer has to either start hunting for the new frequency, effectively hopping after the radar operator, or alternatively flood the entire frequency range with jamming power to make hopping pointless; both counter-actions are feasible but they both have complications of their own.</p> <p>These radars are significantly less susceptible to doppler-notching maneuvers (more on this below).</p> <p>This feature became so important to radar engineering &amp; operations from the mid-1960s that, quite often, the main difference between a very capable domestic radar set and its export-cleared variant was the physical removal of the frequency-hopping circuits in the latter kit.</p> <p>As in other cases, electronic-scan arrays and especially AESAs get massive advantages; in this case, all P/AESAs are automatically considered as being frequency-agile, while older mechanical-scan sets have to explicitly have this declared in the simulation databases.</p> <p>A notch on the bedpost</p> <p>Doppler notching, a maneuver designed to exploit a fundamental flaw in pulse-doppler radars in look-down mode, has been included until now abstractly in CMANO as part of the weapon endgame calculations. This time, however, it can be actively and preemptively used as a maneuver, both for missile track lock-break and for general surveillance radar detection avoidance.</p> <p>Aircraft can attempt to fly perpendicular to an emitter using doppler filtering in order to hide inside its \"blind\" velocity gate. The effectiveness of the maneuver varies with crew skill (an \"ace\" pilot will execute it far more effectively than a novice), to discourage manual micromanagement by players. Aircraft under missile attack with a doppler radar guiding the missile will also actively try to beam the radar instead of the missile (the geometry of the two axes can vary significantly). The maneuver is ineffective against pulse-only radars and less effective against frequency-agile radars.</p> <p>Players can also deliberately plot courses for aircraft that fly perpendicular to known PD search radars, to reduce the actual detection range. (If you're a Microprose F-19/F-117 virtual vet this may bring back some memories).</p> <p>Patrolling in style</p> <p>This has been another popular request: \"I like the flexibility of the patrol mission, but sometimes I want to enforce my custom patrol movement patterns instead of the 'random within defined area' logic, even at the cost of predictability\". Well ask, and ye shall receive -- in the form of an extra patrol mission option: movement style.</p> <p>This option has two settings: \"Random within area\" (default) and \"Repeatable loop\". \"Random within area\" is the patrol behavior you are already familiar with. If \"Repeatable loop\" is selected instead, the assigned units treat the reference points of the patrol area as a racetrack, just like in a support mission. This allows the player (or scenario author) to define precise, consistent patrol patterns (figure-8, expanding spiral, ladder etc.) while also retaining the \"investigate &amp; prosecute\" behavior that distinguishes patrol missions from support ones.</p> <p>When the \"Repeatable loop\" setting is active, the patrol area is depicted very similarly to support mission racetracks, to emphasize the difference:</p> <p>Till death do us part: Merge scenarios</p> <p>This is another gift from the PE world, and we bet it will be a much-appreciated one. If you are a scenario author, you are already familiar with the base &amp; group import/export (i.e. the .inst files), and how convenient and time-saving they can be when putting together the elements of a scenario. This \"construct once, re-use everywhere\" concept has now been taken a step further: You can make individual scenarios and then merge them into a single scenario.</p> <p>Scenario #1 is treated as the \"base\" for the merge, so behind the scenes you are essentially cherry-picking all transferable items from scenario</p>"},{"location":"simulation/#2-and-adding-them-to-scenario-1-the-log-output-also-makes-this","title":"2 and adding them to scenario #1 (the log output also makes this","text":"<p>clear). Elements that are \"atomic\" or otherwise hard to merge (date &amp; time, weather, title &amp; description etc.) will, on the output, be those of scenario #1.</p> <p>The power &amp; versatility of this tool should be readily apparent to anyone who's delved in scenario editing. Now you can create once, store and re-use not just groups or bases, but multiple foundational scenario elements: Sides, missions, events, actions, conditions etc. We have been repeatedly amused by the wacky, quite unforeseen ways the original import/export functionality has been employed by industrious scenario creators, so naturally we are curious to observe how they'll bend this one to their will.</p> <p>Lua loco</p> <p>The Lua API continues its expansion in CMO and offers additional hooks into the simulation engine as well as various methods for pulling the strings of the running scenario. One of the new hooks ties directly into the AI model: You can individually instruct units to, quite literally, not think for themselves (You in the back, quipping \"you mean they do this now?\" -- SIT DOWN!). More specifically, you can set individual units to skip their AI routines for evaluating valid targets and picking out the primary one among them. This has two direct benefits:</p> <p>It makes it easier to implement custom targeting AI routines in Lua, since an author not longer has to \"compete\" with the build-in AI for this.</p> <p>As these routines are among the most CPU-expensive pieces of the simulation pipeline, disabling them can have a drastic effect on the speed &amp; scalability of a large scenario. For example, if you disable the AI cycles of all static/inactive buildings, then only \"active\" units will use the CPU for this work (internally Command already does a lot of such optimizations, but since it cannot \"intrinsically\" know which units are static &amp; inactive, it has to check them, which itself is not free).</p> <p>Additionally, this ability can allow simulating \"dormant\" states for units (e.g. units begin a scenario in a \"comatose\" state, but later because of XYZ they become activated).</p>"},{"location":"update-history/","title":"14.0 COMMAND Update History","text":""},{"location":"update-history/#141-complete-command-update-history","title":"14.1 Complete COMMAND Update History","text":"<p>COMMAND has changed considerably from earlier versions. Many new features have been added, and many UI changes have been made. While much of what applied to early release versions still applies to the latest version, much else does not. As many returning players have left before a specific update time, cataloging all the major changes in earlier releases is in order.</p> <p>For players whose first introduction to COMMAND is the current \"Command: Modern Operations\" version, much of this will not be of any concern. But for players who have been used to the very different mechanics of earlier versions, reading these updates may be helpful to avoid feeling out of place.</p> <p>Version 1.01 (October 2013)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This was a \"quick-fix\" update of glaring issues found right after release. Notable updates include:</p> <p>A dedicated \"weapons\" page in the database viewer.</p> <p>The ability to deselect all reference points via either a menu or by pressing CTRL-END</p> <p>-The ability to zoom to the mouse location instead of the camera center, for the convenience of say, focusing on a contact on the far side of the map.</p> <p>-A new game option: Sonobuoy visibility. The choices are Normal (sonobuoys are prominently displayed), Ghosted (they appear, but in a \"faded\", translucent way), and Do Not Show (not visibly appearing on the map at all)</p> <p>-A new dedicated \"weapon\" page on the Database Viewer. The characteristics of weapons from unguided bombs like the Mk82 to super-smart munitions like the LRASM appear. The weapon's DB entry includes its range, maximum speed/altitude, warhead size, signature, and seeker type/ability.</p> <p>-An \"Abort Launch\" button in the air ops window. When pressed, any selected aircraft beginning the launch sequence will stop and attempt to return to an open parking facility.</p> <p>-Hold-fire can be issued to multiple selected units.</p> <p>-The \"Add Unit\" window now remembers the filters used in the last unit addition whenever it's reapplied. For instance, if the \"Ship\" type filter is selected and the word \"Iowa\" is typed into the \"class\" text box before the window is closed, reopening it will have a filtered list of Iowa-class battleships in plain view.</p> <p>-Major improvements in aircraft dropping ordnance without manual control.</p> <p>Version 1.02 (December 2013)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This was the first major update. Major changes included different realism settings (see 5.4.9 Scenario Features + Settings on page 92) and the first side proficiency changes (see 5.4.4 Add/Edit Sides on page 84)</p> <p>-Per-waypoint speed, altitude and sensor commands. Select the waypoint and either right click or press F2 or F9. The unit will obey the commands when it reaches the waypoint.</p> <p>-Quick Jump slots.</p> <p>Quick Jumps can be used to rapidly shift back to a unit or contact. To use quick jumps:</p> <p>-Select a unit/contact and zoom the camera to the desired level.</p> <p>-Press CTRL+[NUM] (the number can be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc...) and the camera altitude and location will be saved</p> <p>-To jump to that unit/location, either press the initial number or use the \"quick jump\" top level menu and select from the list. The saved numeral is to the right of the unit in the menu for easy reference.</p> <p>-Note that quick jumping doesn't actually select the unit/contact, instead it merely moves to its location.</p> <p>-New game option: Reference point visibility. The options are \"normal\", \"small\", and \"do not show\", the latter two serving to reduce clutter.</p> <p>-The ability to set the activation time in the mission editor. This can be vital for both hands-off normal play and for scenario creators wishing to time missions launched by computer controlled sides.</p> <p>-Side-level proficiency features, ranging from Novice to Ace. Aircraft turn rates and weapon evasion calcs are affected by side proficiency, as is the reaction time of all units.</p> <p>-The map cursor databox (aka Black Box of Data) can be set to appear next to the mouse cursor, at the bottom of the map, or not show at all.</p> <p>-New feature: Mouse preview mode. Hovering over a contact now displays the selection and datablock information for that unit. It's useful for checking contacts quickly.</p> <p>-Can now select new home bases for multiple-selected aircraft.</p> <p>-New title screen selection: Resume from last autosave. This, true to name, loads the last successful autosave. This makes returning to play after an issue easier and more convenient.</p> <p>-Background music is now available. While only one track is included with the game, more can be manually added.</p> <p>-New Realism Option: Unlimited Aircraft Weapons. When checked, this allows aircraft to have unlimited amounts of any loadout available. While this can be unrealistic (i.e. compare the shortage of air-launched Exocets in the Falklands War to the option of having all the Etendards launch repeated mega-salvos with this checked) and unbalancing (the scenario may be predicated on the player having small numbers of certain weapons at the air base), it can be useful for quick scenario editor experiments or scenarios where neither is an issue (i.e. the available aircraft can only carry basic unguided weapons, but they would plausibly be present in large numbers)</p> <p>-Two significant changes to \"bingo\" (unable to safely return to base) fuel calculations. First is different margins. \"High value\" aircraft like tankers and AEW planes will play it \"safer\" and automatically return on larger amounts of fuel than \"expendable\" aircraft like fighters. The second is that any aircraft with fewer than 1,500 liters of fuel is considered \"bingo\" no matter how close or far from an airbase it is.</p> <p>-\"Strategic\" (i.e. ballistic missile) submarines now automatically move to avoid any potential surface or sub threats in their proximity. They're there to launch missiles, not engage in torpedo fights.</p> <p>-New Doctrine Option: Use SAMs in anti-surface mode. This enables or disables the use of naval anti-air missiles in an anti-surface mode. There are valid conditions for using SAMs freely against surface targets and valid conditions for saving them for aircraft.</p> <p>-New Patrol Type: Sea Control Patrol. This folds ASuW [anti surface] and ASW [anti-submarine] patrols into one. Units under a sea control mission will engage both surface and underwater targets.</p> <p>-Manual deployment of dipping sonar. Pressing shift+D with an appropriate helicopter selected will have it hover low over the water and deploy its dipping sonar.</p> <p>-Can now edit names and delete specific aircraft directly through the air operations window.</p> <p>-Sonar and sonobuoy mechanics modifications. First, older and/or lower-frequency sonars are affected more by reverberation in areas like near ice packs or shallow water. Second, aircraft are now constrained by datalink limitations when deploying sonobuoys.</p> <p>-Secondary windows now remember their last positions and sizes between sessions of running COMMAND. This helps users keep to a familiar pattern.</p> <p>-New doctrine option: Engage targets of opportunity. This means that units will engage any contact with which they have suitable weaponry for even if the mission tasking doesn't specifically call for it.</p> <p>EXAMPLE: A carrier group, including escorts with anti-ship missiles, is set to run a routine support mission. If \"engage targets of opportunity\" is engaged, the escorts will automatically fire their ASMs at any appropriate contact when in the proper range. If it is not engaged, they will not unless the mission is changed or they are manually ordered to do so.</p> <p>-New event trigger: Unit Detected. The event will trigger when a unit (filterable to varying degrees) is detected by the specified side.</p> <p>-New event editor change: Event conditions. If included, the event will only fire \"IF\" certain conditions, in this case, side posture, are met. (IE, IF the \"USSR\" side is hostile, the NATO side will fire its nuclear missiles at 0430.</p> <p>-\"Hold Position\" command added to the right-click menu for mobile ground units. This can be used to keep them in place if they've moved an inappropriate distance.</p> <p>-Database hyperlinks added for aircraft (in the \"air ops\" window) and weapons (in the \"unit weapons\" window). Clicking them will bring up the DB viewer with the appropriate entry.</p> <p>Version 1.03 (March 2014)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update was focused on performance, stability, and database issues.</p> <p>-Aircraft loadouts now affect drag (all those bombs hung underneath that F-105 are not going to help its agility).</p> <p>-A staggered list of autosaves, where the most recent autosave is \"autoscen_20\", with each autosave pushed back 20 (real world) seconds until autoscen_100 is reached. This can help with finding issues, as an autosave shortly before (instead of after) the issue can be reached.</p> <p>-Patrol throttle option added. Units with no other override obey this setting. It can be used if the goal is persistence (creep/loiter), covering more ground (cruise) or moving very quickly for the sake of evasiveness (full/flank).</p> <p>-Aircraft with an attack profile lower than the minimum release altitude of their carried weapons will try to fly just above the latter so that they can reliably and precisely drop their weapons (even if it's at the expense of being more vulnerable). Previously, they dropped at maximum altitude, which was poor for any kind of unguided accuracy.</p> <p>-Floating mines can now be detected by visual sensors (including crew Mk1 Eyeballs) on ships and low, slow (less than 150m/450 feet and slower than 200 knots) aircraft.</p> <p>-CTRL+Left Click and Move will create a new waypoint.</p> <p>-Major new game option-no pulse mode. The map and UI refresh every 0.1 seconds and the engine attempts to execute each turn as rapidly as possible. The result is a considerably smoother, quicker-running experience. (No-pulse is the default mode in 2.0)</p> <p>-Engine throttle now affects the IR signature of an aircraft.</p> <p>-Whenever an aircraft being prepared is missing primary stores (for instance, if an airbase has one sortie's worth of bombs, they're used up on the mission, and the survivors attempt to rearm for another go-round), the outfitting is cancelled and the aircraft reverts to \"reserve-clean\" loadout.</p> <p>-Selecting a unit now highlights and \"thickens\" its weapon range symbols in addition to the sensor symbols.</p> <p>-Aircraft returning to base for reasons other than low fuel now return at full rather than cruise throttle if possible to reduce the time of vulnerability.</p> <p>-Unknown contacts can now be designated as friendly with F and neutral with N.</p> <p>-Improved weather effects modelling. Progressively thicker clouds have a progressively worse effect on EO and laser sensors (including laser designators).</p> <p>-Significant tweaks to \"air boss\" AI to unjam runways, maintain formation cohesion and keep from needlessly sending aircraft back to their hangars.</p> <p>Version 1.04 (July 2014)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update introduced a strike \"auto-planner\" and other improvements such as prosecution areas for patrols (see 7.2.3 Patrol Mission on page 146) and sprint-and-drift movement for warships.</p> <p>-New option to turn off the BMNG layer, which returns the map to a \"retro\" wireframe format.</p> <p>-Added quick jump top level menu which lists all saved quick jump slots.</p> <p>-Prosecution areas (additional zones that patrolling units will not enter normally, but will pursue contacts in) added as an option to patrol missions. Prosecution areas act as a way to restrain patrolling units. For example, with a prosecution area, a patrolling aircraft neither breaks away from its scheduled patrol to investigate a contact far away from the combat area nor tries to follow retreating enemy fighters all the way back to airfields with known SAM batteries around them.</p> <p>-Added double-click functionality.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Plotting course (F3): double-click when placing the last waypoint when plotting a course to exit Plot Course mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using Distance/Bearing tool (Ctrl + D): double-click to exit Distance/Bearing tool.</p> </li> </ul> <p>-Added CTRL+click and drag functionality. By pressing the CTRL key and clicking-dragging a waypoint or reference point that already exists, a new one can be made.</p> <p>-Most hotkeys now have a menu item. Three new menu categories added ('View', 'Contact' and 'Quick Jump')</p> <p>-Added new window accessible via \"Help-Hotkeys\" that displays all hotkeys.</p> <p>Added new hotkeys, including:</p> <p>V - Switch unit/group view, for laptops without a numeric keypad</p> <p>Ctrl+V - Toggle God's Eye view</p> <p>F11 - open Mission Editor</p> <p>Ctrl+F11 - create new mission</p> <p>Ctrl+F9 - unit/group Doctrine + EMCON</p> <p>Ctrl+R - rename Reference Point (not sharing 'R' hotkey with Rename Unit)</p> <p>Ctrl+Del - delete selected ref point(s)</p> <p>Ctrl+Ins - add ref point</p> <p>B - return to base</p> <p>Ctrl+M - clear message log</p> <p>A - Toggle Hold Fire for selected units (no AI attacks)</p> <p>Ctrl+A - Toggle Hold Fire for all units on current side (no AI attacks)</p> <p>I - Toggle Ignore plotted path when attacking for selected unit</p> <p>Ctrl + I - Toggle Ignore plotted path when attacking for all units on current side</p> <p>E - Drop Target(s)</p> <p>Ctrl + E - Disengage (Drop all targets)</p> <p>L - Hold Position for selected unit(s)</p> <p>Ctrl + L - Hold Position for all units</p> <p>Alt+S - Toggle sides (switch sides) in scenario editor</p> <p>P - Drop contact(s)</p> <p>-Ability to configure ghosted unit visibility for groups under \"map settings-show ghosted group members for...\"</p> <p>-Ability to configure plotted course visibility under \"map settings-plotted courses\".</p> <p>-For ease of examining the mission details, the assigned mission description in the unit status window is now a hyperlink. Clicking it opens the mission editor with the mission in question selected.</p> <p>-Detected non-friendly unit groups (i.e. airfields, naval bases, mobile groups) are shown as groups (one \"group\" icon) rather than as units (many individual icons) when in \"group view\".</p> <p>-There are now eleven preset cloud cover profiles, with the mouse pointer containing more information on them:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Thick fog 0-2k ft, solid cloud cover 7-36k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Thin fog 0-2k ft, solid cloud cover 7-36k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Solid middle clouds 7-16k ft, moderate high clouds 30-36k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate middle clouds 7-16k ft, light high clouds 27-30k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate high clouds 25-28k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate middle clouds 7-16k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Moderate low clouds 2-7k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Light high clouds 20-23k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Light middle clouds 10-16k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Light low clouds 5-7k ft</p> </li> <li> <p>Clear sky</p> </li> </ul> <p>-Offboard sonar sensors (towed arrays, VDS) get half the own-powerplant noise reductions as hull sonars and a further reduction from the existing thermal layer and deep channel modifiers-there is a reason units that have them are considered highly capable.</p> <p>-When the player attempts to load a scenario that uses a missing database, COMMAND informs them of this and aborts the load.</p> <p>-The AI can now fire heavyweight torpedoes (i.e. 650mm Soviet monsters) at a maximum range of 8 nautical rather than the minimum of six kilometers. Later updates would allow for more fine-tuning of torpedo launches.</p> <p>-The database \"Weapon\" page now features guidance details for the currently displayed weapon, useful for, say, seeing what versions of a missile have an IR seeker and which have an SARH seeker (the Soviets loved making dual versions of the same airframe).</p> <p>-The AI can now engage enemy SAMs in anti-surface mode if able.</p> <p>-Significant improvements to intercept logic against extremely fast targets (such as ballistic missiles and satellites). Launcher units begin tracking at much longer distances and ensure all mandatory datalinks can be established.</p> <p>Version 1.05 (September 2014)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update was the first to be released on Steam and introduced a huge reform of aerial refueling operations, non-cooperative target recognition radars, and \"cranking\" (slowing down in aerial combat as much as possible to reduce the time to close the distance).</p> <p>Aerial Refueling: This update introduced many changes to help aerial refueling. The three biggest changes were:</p> <p>-Crews becoming better and more context-aware about picking tankers.</p> <p>-Tankers becoming better with managing their own fuel, to prevent aircraft completely emptying them.</p> <p>-Aircraft returning from missions no longer headed for tankers if not necessary.</p> <p>There were subsequent tanker improvements between this and V2.</p> <p>NCTR: Certain radars have a \"non-cooperative target recognition\" function. As of V2, the database entry for a unit will, on its sensors list, contain a note if the radar has NCTR capability or not. The two types of NCTR radars are:</p> <p>JEM-Jet Engine Modulation. This requires a \"look\" at the blades of the engine, and thus requires the target's front to be facing the radar (within 15 degrees).</p> <p>NBILST-Narrow Beam Interleaved Search and Track. This is more advanced and can work from any angle.</p> <p>BVR Cranking:</p> <p>Starting in this update, aircraft launching BVR missiles proceeded to \"crank\" after firing. Cranking means the launching aircraft will simultaneously slow down and turn as far away as possible from the target while still being able to guide the missile. The goal is to preserve the range advantage as much as possible. The degree to which aircraft can crank is now customizable in V2.</p> <p>Damage Reform</p> <p>-Damage rates to vehicle subsystems increased, messages updating the player on their status appeared in the message log, and the damage control window now color-coded subsystems in various levels of damage. Yellow is lightly damaged, orange is moderately damaged, orange-red is heavily damaged, and red remains the color for a system that's destroyed outright.</p> <p>Version 1.06 (December 2014)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update introduced Lua scripting (see 5.3 Lua on page 78), differing turnaround times for aircraft (see 3.3.7 Air Operations on page 32), and unit level proficiency settings.</p> <p>-Lua: This update introduced the first Lua scripting functionality into COMMAND. In this update, Lua was introduced as an \"action\" in the event editor. Scripts included spawning units, assigning/swapping missions, changing EMCON settings, and changing the weather.</p> <p>-Surge and quick-turnaround times in air operations: Doctrine can now be set for either \"Surge\" (the previous default, rapid pace like at the start or climax of a campaign) or \"sustained\" (significantly slower, \"one package a day\" model) mode that will affect how long it takes to ready aircraft. Quick-turnaround has been introduced for certain loadouts that have both simple weapons (i.e. usually unguided bombs/rockets, nothing that requires advanced setup/programming) and an inherently simple mission (i.e. \"fly out, bomb, repeat as necessary). However, after a certain amount of flight time, a long cooldown period is needed.</p> <p>The default quick-turnaround mode is for \"fighters and ASW\" aircraft, which allows for appropriate aircraft with simple anti air/submarine loadouts (that would realistically need to launch quickly) to deploy rapidly without unbalancing the rest of the scenario.</p> <p>-Unit level proficiency settings. While side-level proficiency settings were added in 1.02, this enables it to be changed for specific units to simulate differences among individual crews/formations. Whereas in past versions of COMMAND, one would have to make two different allied sides (IE, \"Iraqi Republican Guard\", \"Iraqi Regular Army\") to have varying proficiency, this enables a scenario creator to have one individual side (IE, merely \"Iraq\") and individual units varying from aces to novices.</p> <p>-New feature: Satellite pass predictions. For all their invaluable strengths, one large, constant weakness of satellites has been their predictable paths. Selecting this function from the \"game\" menu and clicking at any point on the map will bring up a prediction window of how long it will take for the satellites in the scenario to reach that point and how long they will stay in sensor coverage once there.</p> <p>-Patrol/Support altitude overrides. Aircraft on patrol and support missions can be ordered to fly at a specific altitude, either in transit or on station.</p> <p>-Radars able to detect ground targets are now limited by target speeds. A stopped unit is harder to pick up on radar than a moving one.</p> <p>-\"Submarine Datum\" contact: If an inbound torpedo is detected, a circular 10nm wide submarine contact is generated under the premise that the launching unit is close by somewhere. If a sub-launched missile is observed leaving the water, likewise a smaller 1nm sub contact is generated. This makes ASW more effective.</p> <p>-Improved refreshing of the DB viewer window when different units/weapons are selected, preventing the need to constantly close and reopen it.</p> <p>-Fixed a long-standing bug on the \"unit enters area trigger\" where the event would fire continuously whenever the unit was in the area. Now it fires properly when the unit \"steps in\".</p> <p>-Special Reserved Variable For Event Engine: UnitX. This is a global (scenario-wide) variable representing the active unit responsible for firing any of these triggers:</p> <p>-- Unit is damaged</p> <p>-- Unit is destroyed</p> <p>-- Unit is detected</p> <p>-- Unit enters an area</p> <p>-- Unit remains in area</p> <p>So whichever unit causes of the above triggers to fire, it gets tagged as \"UnitX\".</p> <p>You can then use this special variable as a reference in any Lua-mapped function that takes a unit's name/ObjectID as a parameter (so for example you can dictate \"whichever unit enters this area will get assigned to this mission\").</p> <p>-New Message Type: Mine Contact. Like all other message types, it can be configured to show a popup and appear on the message log. This specifically has to deal with naval mine contacts-a warning that one might have approached a minefield may be important.</p> <p>-Altitude parameters on a loadout's mission profile are now enforced for patrol and support missions.</p> <p>-Select New Homebase now works for all unit types, not just aircraft and groups of aircraft.</p> <p>-New event trigger type: Scenario is loaded. If the current scenario time is at or before the \"start of scenario\" date and time and the scenario is loaded, the trigger is activated. This is an alternative to the older \"timed for one second after scenario start\" trigger used for a similar effect.</p> <p>-Improved cloud and thermal layer indicators on throttle/altitude window. This displays a series of indicators at various altitudes indicated where the clouds/layers are. This helps for determining say, the right altitude to fly a laser-guided bomb strike at, so that the designator isn't blocked by the cloud.</p> <p>-Patrol change: Minimum # of units on station. This can be used to try and put a certain number of units on station at any one time. When it and the 1/3rd rule are both checked, the larger number takes precedence.</p> <p>-Additional factor for naval gunnery-ship size. A large ship will be more stable even in rough seas, while a small vessel will get tossed around more, limiting its accuracy.</p> <p>-Modified patrol behavior for aircraft. Aircraft will stop pursuing an identified target if they do not have the means to engage it. This solved the \"Without being microed away, your MPA flies in circles above a hostile ship until it gets shot down\" issue.</p> <p>-Torpedoes can be fired to max kinematic range. A new doctrine option (configurable for units and sides) allows torpedoes to be launched at their kinematic range. This can be set for manual shots only or AI engagement as well.</p> <p>(WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED AGAINST ANYTHING EXCEPT A COMPLETELY UNAWARE TARGET. DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU)</p> <p>-New ScenEdit feature: Clone unit. Unit customizations are copied along with the original class and name of the unit.</p> <p>-Added option to identify the selected unit/contact's image as a thumbnail on the right-side information panel.</p> <p>-Aircraft on RTB orders for reasons other than fuel exhaustion now accept course orders.</p> <p>-Pressing CTRL-X now copies the lat/long coordinates in decimal form at the current mouse cursor location to the clipboard. For example, pressing CTRL-X while the mouse cursor is hovering over Reykjavik, Iceland and then pasting will get the coordinates latitude='64.1305923461914', longitude='-21.8313770294189'.</p> <p>This can be very useful for say, getting the right spot for a Lua script to spawn a unit later.</p> <p>Version 1.07 (March 2015)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update introduced...</p> <p>-Weapon release authorization. Players can configure the number of weapons launched against a specific target, the number of launchers in a salvo, and can limit the range at which the AI will fire a weapon (i.e. so that they don't waste weapons in a launch that will almost if not certainly miss)</p> <p>-A revamped mission editor. Compared to the pre-1.07 mission editor, the newer one enables flight size changes, \"scrub measures\" (to enable one-and-done strikes or to prevent increasingly smaller flights from pointlessly taking off to something they can't complete), and the choice of straight-line or angled flight paths. See http://www.warfaresims.com/?p=3653</p> <p>-\"Auto-bundled\" scenario attachments. See http://www.warfaresims.com/?p=3710</p> <p>-Updated UI functionality.</p> <p>Updated functionality</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ignore plotted course when attacking: moved to doctrine</p> </li> <li> <p>Hold Fire turned into doctrine setting and merged with Engage Unknown to become Weapon Control Setting (WCS)</p> </li> <li> <p>Added menu item to window for configuring Quick Turnaround for airborne aircraft</p> </li> <li> <p>Added menu item to window for setting fuel and airborne time for airborne aircraft</p> </li> </ul> <p>Doctrine changes</p> <ul> <li> <p>Doctrine tab in Doctrine window re-done</p> </li> <li> <p>EMCON tab in Doctrine window updated</p> </li> <li> <p>Added Weapon Release Authorization (WRA) tab to Doctrine window</p> </li> <li> <p>Ctrl + Shift + F9 opens side-wide Doctrine window</p> </li> </ul> <p>Air Ops (F6) window</p> <ul> <li> <p>Added 'Assign to mission' button to allow the player to assign aircraft to missions</p> </li> <li> <p>Added 'Doctrine' button to update various setting for aircraft whilst still on the ground</p> </li> <li> <p>Added context (right mouse-click) menu</p> </li> </ul> <p>Boat Ops (F7) window</p> <ul> <li> <p>Window redone, added 'Abort launch' button and synched looks and functionality with AirOps</p> </li> <li> <p>Added 'Assign to mission' button to allow the player to assign boats to missions</p> </li> <li> <p>Added 'Doctrine' button to update various setting for boats whilst still in dock/davit</p> </li> <li> <p>Added context (right mouse-click) menu</p> </li> </ul> <p>Weapon Allocation ('Attack Target') window</p> <p>The Weapon Allocation window has been re-designed. One of the most noticeable changes is the ability to multi-select targets and assign salvos to all with one mouse click. This functionality uses the Weapon Release Authorization (WRA) table to automatically create fire missions with pre-defined weapon quantities. It should be noted that assigning salvos this way does not take into account shooter limitations or automatic fire range limitations. Pressing the 'Assign Salvo' button multiple times will add additional salvo quantities of weapons.</p> <p>Another significant change is that the number of weapons fired or already impacted as part of the ongoing salvo are displayed alongside yet-to-fire (assigned) weapons. This means the player gets a much better overview of what targets are currently under fire and the weapons involved.</p> <p>The updated window also allows the player to add and remove shooting units and targets. In theory, this means that the player only needs to open the window once per scenario, and add/remove units and targets as needed. Destroyed units and targets are automatically cleared from the list.</p> <p>Finally, the player can now resize the window, and it will also auto-update when the player runs the simulator. The player can also de-allocate large quantities of weapons with one mouse click.</p> <p>Mission Editor</p> <p>* The \"Area Editor\" component (used on mission editor etc.) has a new button: \"Highlight + center on selected\". If one or more reference points are currently selected, clicking this button highlights them and brings the map camera to their geographic center. This is useful, for example, for quickly seeing and moving around the reference points that comprise a patrol area.</p> <p>Contact management</p> <p>* New UI feature: You can now filter-out a selected contact (\"Filter-out\" command on the contact context/right-click menu). Filtered-out contacts are shown ghosted and no information on their movement vector, sensor &amp; weapon range symbols and AoU is presented on the map. This can be useful if you have a lot of contacts of no interest (e.g. neutrals) on the map and want to eliminate the clutter they create. You can cancel a contact's filter-out status the same way.</p> <p>You can temporarily override a contact's filtered-out status by hovering the mouse cursor over it. This allows filtering-out multiple contacts to reduce map clutter, and then checking them individually \"at a glance\" to determine if they're worth resetting their filter-out.</p> <p>-Land Range for weapons: Weapons now have separate ranges for hitting land targets (i.e. a naval gun that's limited by its fire control against moving sea targets but only by ballistics against stationary land ones) and additional range rings for the land range.</p> <p>-AAW engagements are now heavily dependent on the target's speed and angle. Previously, an aircraft would get a full evasion bonus no matter what the context. Now, a missile aimed at a slower (by fighter aircraft standards) from the rear will have a realistically higher chance of hitting than one aimed at the side of a rapidly moving opponent.</p> <p>-AAW missiles (i.e. mostly naval SAMs) attacking large enough targets now disable proximity fuses and rely on their (considerable) kinetic energy to do the damage instead.</p> <p>-Submarine battery recharge rate has been significantly increased, and the recharge rate is faster the slower the submarine is moving (the diesels can recharge the batteries and not drive the sub)</p> <p>-AI Doctrine Improvements:</p> <p>-Aircraft will use the tempo settings of their current bases unless overridden by unit/mission level doctrine settings.</p> <p>-New \"Weapons Control Status\" replaces \"fire at unidentified contact\" and \"hold fire\". The three new settings are \"Weapons Free\" (fire at any non-\"friendly\" contact\"), \"weapons tight\" (fire at confirmed hostile targets) and \"weapons hold\" (only fire in immediate self-defense).</p> <p>-Airborne aircraft assigned via menu to existing strike missions will have flight plans automatically generated.</p> <p>Version 1.08 (July 2015)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update focused on UI and simulation improvements.</p> <p>-New Weapon Types: Anti-torpedo torpedoes and related warning systems.</p> <p>-New weapon type: Enhanced fragmentation warheads, intended as a modern alternative to cluster rounds.</p> <p>-New weapon type: contact explosive (sabotage and suicide).</p> <p>-New \"ship\" (aka \"that's no island, it's an aircraft carrier\") category: Mobile Offshore Base. The hypothetical Mobile Offshore Base has been added to the database and is designed to accommodate any aircraft type that can fit on its runway, even one that isn't normally carrier-capable (so a MOB can hold F-16s and A-10s, for example)</p> <p>-Aircraft body IR signatures are now dependent on speed. This mainly affects aircraft that can move very fast (and thus have a lot of heat friction) for a sustained time.</p> <p>-Bringing up the weapons window and clicking the \"show arcs\" checkbox now reveals the engagement arc of a unit mount.</p> <p>-The manual weapon allocation window can now optionally present \"soft\" restrictions (ROE, etc..) which prevent auto-fire even if the \"hard\" restrictions (ability to see/illuminate the target) are in effect.</p> <p>-Targeting vectors turn yellow when the unit is physically able to engage the target but not cleared to do so, and green when they are cleared.</p> <p>-Added \"reset all side scores\" on Losses/Expenditures window.</p> <p>-Coastlines and borders now fade out as the player zooms in on the terrain.</p> <p>-Subs now always snorkel/recharge if at periscope depth or higher, and now handle their speed more intelligently (via approach speed and knowing not to chase targets they'll never catch)</p> <p>-Snap up/down (how fast and far they can move vertically) limits are now applied to AAW guided weapons.</p> <p>-Side-firing (AC-130, etc....) gunships now maneuver properly to line up their weapons.</p> <p>-UNREP is now performed at a more realistic pace, and fixes have been introduced to prevent overloading mounts on the ship being replenished.</p> <p>-New side-level option: Can auto-track civilians. The selected side automatically sees and tracks civilian/commercial units. This simulates access to publicly available tracking sources, and can be useful for law enforcement scenarios or to keep units from pointlessly chasing obvious civilian contacts.</p> <p>-Mechanical-scan radars can no longer conduct volume scans while guiding a weapon, going \"blind\" while doing so (this is why fighters operate in pairs!). (An advantage of phased array and ICWI radars is that they can)</p> <p>Version 1.09 (October 2015)</p> <p>This update accompanied the Northern Inferno DLC. New features included campaigns (5.4.2, Campaigns), EMP blasts from nuclear detonations that can destroy sensors, and new Lua scripts (5.3, Lua.)</p> <p>-Campaigns. This allowed for the creation of campaigns like Northern Inferno. Players can now create a set of linked scenarios with a score threshold that must be met to progress to the next scenario and an ending description.</p> <p>-EMP blasts. Nuclear detonations now produce an EMP blast. The effect of the blast does not depend on the yield of the nuclear warhead, but rather on its altitude and distance to the target. The state of the target system also matters. A turned-off system can still be affected but is less vulnerable. Extremely important is the generation of the system-early vacuum tube electronics are the most resistant, which each succeeding generation becoming less and less so.</p> <p>-Lua: Two Lua scripts were added:</p> <p>Add Explosion. This enables a warhead to be detonated in a certain place and altitude. This can be used to simulate everything from high-altitude EMP-inducing nuclear blasts to conventional explosions. The ID number of a warhead used for the detonation can be found in the \"weapons\" section of the database under \"warheads\".</p> <p>Change Unit Side. Self-explanatory, this allows a unit to switch between sides. It can be used to simulate something like a boarding party taking over a vessel.</p> <p>New Map Features:</p> <p>-Place Names. This toggleable option included countries, cities, and major geographic features.</p> <p>-Contact Emission changes. Either all emissions (so an SA-2 site would display both the Spoon Rest search radar AND Fan Song FCR) or only fire-control related emissions (just the Fan Song). This feature was added to prevent clutter when viewing contact with large numbers of sensors emitting.</p> <p>Version 1.10 (February 2016)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update included Steam Workshop support. It also included cruise missile waypoints (so they can go around enemy SAM sites or behind mountains to conceal themselves), improvements to the ECM model, weight-dependent aircraft kinematics, and improved \"Cooperative engagement capacity\" (where something other than the launcher can guide weapons).</p> <p>-Special Actions: These Lua script actions can be created by the scenario editor and activated in normal play as a sort of gamble. For instance, a player can attempt a high-risk, high-reward commando operation or conduct a routine request for reinforcements.</p> <p>-Steam Workshop: Now COMMAND scenarios can be uploaded to the Steam Workshop. To upload, simply go to the editor menu (in the Steam version, of course), and select \"Publish Scenario To Steam Workshop.\"</p> <p>-Waypoints for cruise missile attacks. To use them, go to 'weapons allocated by selected attacker(s)' in the \"engage targets (manual)\" window, press the 'plot course' button, and then 'draw' an appropriate path, pressing the F3 button when a satisfactory one has been created. The courses can be reset by clicking the 'clear course' button in the window.</p> <p>-Improved ABM modeling. This update introduced changes to anti-ballistic engagements so that complex situations like the Patriot-vs-Scud engagements in the Gulf War could be readily simulated.</p> <p>Ordinary SAM warheads now have only a 15% chance of outright destroying a ballistic missile target even if the endgame calc to hit it is successful. They have a 30% chance of causing a significant (CEP tripled) deviation of the warhead's path. Otherwise, it will only cause a minor deviation (1.5x CEP).</p> <p>Advanced SAM warheads include \"Directional-frag\" warheads that double the previous values (30% destruction, 60% significant deviation), and \"hit to kill\" warheads that, if they connect, will reliably destroy the missile every time.</p> <p>Trajectory deviation multipliers for ABM engagements that don't outright destroy the missile are cumulative. This means, particularly if the ballistic missile wasn't the most accurate to begin with, that a series of hits that fail to completely destroy the warhead can still knock it away from its intended target.</p> <p>-Aircraft kinematics affected by weight. Aircraft now have a \"weight fraction\" rating of the weapons and fuel load carried on them compared to the nominal, best-case scenario (clean and not much much). Even before other factors like crew skill, missile position, and altitude come into play, an aircraft with a higher weight fraction will be less maneuverable and thus less likely to avoid an attack.</p> <p>-Cooperative Engagement Capability. What this means in short is that a unit other than the launching one can guide a weapon provided it has a proper datalink. To elaborate, it rapidly expands the possibilities, turning weapons into more than the sum of their parts. An E-2D with CEC datalinks can aid greatly in fleet defense, as it can look down and cover a far larger area than warships blocked by the horizon, terrain, or both.</p> <p>-Improvements to electronic warfare modeling. Older-generation jammers are less effective against modern radars and vice versa. Phased-array radars (especially AESAs) are particularly effective at avoiding being jammed.</p> <p>Version 1.11 (May 2016)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update introduced pier operations for long term scenarios (see 3.3.8 Boat Operations on page 34), more advanced options for aerial doctrine (i.e. to enable being cautious on fuel or \"fire one salvo and run\" attacks), the ability to spot enemy aircraft/ships in their host bases, advanced submarine doctrine, and further refining of aerial refueling doctrine.</p> <p>-Expanded \"Winchester\" and \"Shotgun\" weapons states. Aircraft can do everything from launch one long-range salvo and return to base to stay around and fight to the last cannon round.</p> <p>-Expanded \"Joker\" and \"Chicken\" fuel states that trigger fuel-based RTBs other than the previous \"Bingo\" fuel state.</p> <p>-Pier Operations. Ships can be rearmed and repaired at suitable bases now, although it takes considerable amounts of time for all but the smallest ships. Because of this, a \"withdraw/redeploy\" settings window has been added to determine when they go out and when they go back (there are more than a few historical occasions of not-fully repaired ships being pushed back out because of time constraints).</p> <p>-Hosted units (aircraft/ships) at bases can now be observed by other sides if they're in an open facility like tarmac spaces or are spotted taxiing to a closed hangar.</p> <p>-Massive improvements to air-to-air refueling mechanics. See http://www.warfaresims.com/?p=4190</p> <p>-Major update to submarine mechanics. Air Independent Propulsion systems have gotten a major rework, now being only able to keep up with battery series at creep throttle. Many new submarine doctrine features have been added, such as:</p> <p>-Dive when threat is detected (with the intensity of the \"threat\") configurable.</p> <p>-Recharge battery %, transit/station-choosing the point when the submarine snorkels to recharge its batteries.</p> <p>-Recharge battery %, offensive/defensive-as above, only when the submarine is actually engaged in combat.</p> <p>-AIP usage. Allows the player to limit AIP usage, including saving it for combat.</p> <p>-Dipping sonar. Enables unassigned helicopters to dip their sonar if they're at the right altitude. Disabling it means they'll only dip if manually ordered or on an appropriate mission.</p> <p>-Avoid contact-selectable options are \"yes\" and \"no\".</p> <p>-Significant changes to replenishment rates, both UNREP and in piers.</p> <p>-Aircraft may now jettison their ATG stores under attack when a doctrine setting allows for the sake of maneuverability under fire.</p> <p>-Refined pathfinding engine. There's an optional \"fine-grain\" navigation configuration that's more precise but highly CPU-intensive.</p> <p>-Unguided bombs and rockets dropped in salvos now use a more realistic \"stick\" method of landing. In previous versions of COMMAND, a large volley of bombs would \"splatter\" across a wider area, each one being considered its own calculation. After this update (and in V2), they will fall in a line near the area of the first impact. The dispersion of the weapons still can vary based on factors like altitude, the proficiency of the dropping aircraft, and the technology level of the bombsight on the dropping aircraft.</p> <p>This means that an aircraft unleashing all its unguided weapons in one volley can only truly attack one aimpoint at a time, meaning area damage is dependent on more bombs (there's a reason for the monster potential bombloads on classic aircraft like the A-6) and that a stick of bombs dropped from say, an old bomber with a rusty crew from high altitude against an airfield can easily (and realistically) miss it altogether and do no damage to the target.</p> <p>-Changed how facility aimpoints, especially armored ones, are affected by blast damage.</p> <p>-Changed cluster bomblet effects-due to having many small explosions, they are now much more likely to cause fires and inflict component damage.</p> <p>-Units can no longer perform component repairs if they have more than minor flooding or fire. The crew is too concerned with trying to keep the ship from sinking or exploding to worry about the radar dish with disconnected wires.</p> <p>-Only minor component damage can be completely fixed while a ship is underway. More serious repairs can only be conducted in a port.</p> <p>-Due to the introduction of pier operations, \"Unlimited Weapons At Airbases\" realism setting is now changed to \"Unlimited Base Weapons\", covering ports (i.e. reloads for missile boats) as well as air bases.</p> <p>-The \"Docking ops\" window now has additional columns to display fuel, damage, and weapons. It also has color-coding to determine a unit's readiness compared to doctrine (an AI unit will only deploy if it's all \"green\", but it can still be overridden manually by a human side).</p> <p>-Terrain-following \"above ground level\" (as opposed to \"above sea level\") settings are now available for aircraft under the throttle/altitude window. This enables units with terrain following radar capabilities (i.e. F-111s) to do their thing.</p> <p>-When a mission fails to launch aircraft, a logged message explaining why is now generated.</p> <p>-New \"Game Speed\" options window to disable features that cause slowdowns.</p> <p>-Mine deployment depths are now displayed in the DB viewer.</p> <p>-Area validation-all windows with area editors now have a \"validate area\" button to see if the polygons are valid or not. All areas in a scenario are automatically validated on load, and a warning is given if invalid polygons have been made (this happens often with older scenarios made in early versions of COMMAND).</p> <p>Version 1.11 SR1</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>-Significant improvements to stick bombing mechanisms. The type of aircraft and number of bombs now has an effect on spacing between individual bombs.</p> <p>-All weapon impacts (hits and misses) are now briefly shown on the map.</p> <p>-When using the \"zoom to the cursor position\" option, after zooming, the mouse cursor is re-centered at the map.</p> <ul> <li>Keyboard tweaks. Spacebar instead of F12 now pauses the game. | shifts to the next unit.</li> </ul> <p>-COMMAND can now load and run much larger scenarios with over 10,000 active units.</p> <p>-Fixed an issue where an autosave failing due to memory exhaustion crashed COMMAND. Instead, a popup is displayed notifying the player of the failure.</p> <p>-Improved support for high-DPI desktop resolutions.</p> <p>-Recording tweak: Maintain God's Eye enabled/disabled preference between frames during playback.</p> <p>-You can now enable/disable non-navigation zones and exclusion zones, in two ways:</p> <p>a) Through the UI, as the grids on the relevant windows have an extra \"Is Active\" checkbox for each zone entry.</p> <p>b) Through Lua. Usage example:</p> <p>mySide = VP_GetSide({Name=\"US\"})</p> <p>myZone = mySide:getnonavzone(\"AAW Zone 1\") [Alternative for excl. zone: myZone = mySide:getexclusionzone(\"Forbidden Zone 1\")]</p> <p>myZone.isactive = \"True\"/\"False\"</p> <p>Inactive no-navigation zones are not rendered on the map at all. Inactive exclusion zones are rendered with a dash line (instead of solid).</p> <p>Version 1.11 SR6</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>-Wholly revised right column UI, intended to be compatible with as many DPI settings as possible.</p> <p>-\"Damage control\" button and flame damage indicator now enabled for aircraft.</p> <p>-Detected jamming emissions are now in yellow text and do not fade.</p> <p>-Active sonars now have a \"bottom bounce\" mode.</p> <p>-Mobile facility contacts now have the same expiration time (2 in-game hours) as surface contacts.</p> <p>-Ship AI tweak: Do not adjust speed for cavitation when on a simple plotted course.</p> <p>-Weapons that impact on a set of coordinates now check if a target is actually there.</p> <p>-Aircraft and aerial weapons that travel at high-supersonic/hypersonic speeds now get a massive (if linear) boost in their IR signature.</p> <p>Version 1.11 SR7</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>-New map/UI feature-directional unit icons. Can be selected by choosing the \"directional stylized\" option under \"map display\".</p> <p>-Revised \"realism options\" window. The features are now more visible and cannot be changed in normal play.</p> <p>-The unit magazines window now lists weapons by non-empty/empty first, and then alphabetically, so that the player can quickly see what weapons are available.</p> <p>-The \"New Contact\" message type is supplemented by more focused types devoted to individual types of unit (land, air, surfaced, and submerged). This allows certain contact appearances to be more \"noticeable\" in message log settings (i.e. a submarine that's the entire point of the scenario in question can raise a clock-stopping popup when detected, while a flurry of land contacts caused by an aerial recon run over an enemy division doesn't overload the log)</p> <p>-Ships now maneuver to unmask the preferred mount for firing (try it with a Perry frigate with its mid-mounted gun).</p> <p>-Non-aircraft units can now use escort logic (currently only for strike missions)</p> <p>-When creating an \"airborne\" salvo (e.g. ballistic missile firing RV), if the target is an aimpoint, assume we're firing at an actual target contact, and that is the one nearest to the aimpoint.</p> <p>-Reimplemented incendiary weapons. The effect of an incendiary weapon depends on both the target's size and armor levels.</p> <p>-Gun rounds now lose kinetic energy the farther they travel, with corresponding effects on their damage and penetration.</p> <p>-Detection checks now take sensor min/max altitudes into effect. (Many air-search radars have low detection altitudes, for instance).</p> <p>-The localization logic previously used for ASW aircraft prosecutions is now used for any non-aircraft unit searching for a known but imprecise contact.</p> <p>-Added loiter ability for certain tactical decoys.</p> <p>-Large number of new and updated Lua methods.</p> <p>-Lua commands and responses (including errors) now saved to a log file.</p> <p>-Improved Lua error handling. Errors are displayed and execution stops when running in console mode. When running from special-actions, the function returns NIL but the script continues to run. The error is shown in the Lua variable '_errmsg_' and the function in '_errfnc_'</p> <p>Version 1.12 (May 2017)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update accompanied the Chains of War DLC. New features include comms disruption (see 12.6 Comms Disruption &amp; Cyber Attacks on page 291), aircraft damage (see 5.4.9 Scenario Features + Settings on page 92), lasers, railguns, and EMPs.</p> <p>-Major new feature: Comms Disruption. This enables realistic cutoffs from the network. (awaiting new revision)</p> <p>-Major new feature: Aircraft damage. Now aircraft (when the feature is enabled) are no longer destroyed by any successful hit. Larger and/or more heavily armored aircraft are more resistant to damage. Damaged aircraft that return safely to base can still require long periods of time to repair-frequently longer than the remaining time in the scenario.</p> <p>-Major new feature: Cargo. Now amphibious and air-landing operations no longer need to be \"simulated\" with either teleportation events or Lua spawns. Cargo operations can be performed manually or as part of a cargo mission.</p> <p>-New weapon types.</p> <p>Lasers</p> <p>Tactical EMP</p> <p>Railguns/HVPs</p> <p>-New 2x time acceleration setting, in case real time was too slow and 5x was too fast.</p> <p>-Improved support for 4K/UHD screens.</p> <p>-\"NO-CAV\" is now displayed on the unit status panel for a unit deliberately slowing down to avoid cavitation.</p> <p>-Addition to passive sonar model-Sonar masking. A quieter unit can use the noise generated by a louder one to hide. This is, unsurprisingly, less effective against more advanced sonars.</p> <p>-Lua: Fix manual/desired speed on SetUnit()</p> <p>-Lua: Enhance EndScenario trigger/action</p> <p>-Lua: Enhanced \"Unit Detected\" event trigger</p> <p>Version 1.13 (October 2017)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update added chaff dropping, changes to AAW/ABM mechanics (with more advanced missiles being more capable and taking intercept angles into account), and a new Lua console which serves as the base one in VNEXT.</p> <p>-New Feature: Tactical Chaff Laying. Under \"attack options\", a unit can be ordered to lay down either a single bundle of chaff (single burst) or keep going until it runs out or is ordered to stop (continuous stream).</p> <p>While disruptive to radar, chaff has its limitations which led to its relative decrease. First, aircraft must be in rather than simply behind the corridor, and, when faced with 3D radars, must take care with their altitude so that they're at the same level as the cloud.</p> <p>Chaff is also most effective against older and/or lower frequency radar sets. A modern AESA will simply ignore it completely.</p> <p>-New feature accessible from the throttle/altitude window: Sprint and drift for single units. The set speed is now the average speed, with the AI speeding up and slowing down as necessary.</p> <ul> <li>Isolated-POV (on-grid status) tweak: Visual indicators (dashed rectangle) for which of the displayed contacts are actually detected by the selected unit.</li> </ul> <p>-Changes to AAW mechanics with detailed aircraft damage. Planes with a pressurized cabin are instantly destroyed if they have fuselage penetration, there's a chance the flight controls will be destroyed (dooming the aircraft) in fuselage hits, anti-missile engagements now have reduced chances to hit in oblique/crossing engagements, and AAMs with advanced fuses can do more than their nominal amount of damage.</p> <p>-New V2 Lua console. This serves as the Lua console in COMMAND 2.0</p> <p>Version 1.14 (February 2018)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update accompanied the Silent Service DLC. It includes contact detections on the right sidebar (so the player can see what detected a certain contact), a \"do not cavitate\" option for ships or subs wanting to stay quiet, and reattack capabilities for torpedoes and certain missiles that initially missed.</p> <p>-New UI feature: Recent contact detections. Contact recent detections, i.e. a list of the most recent successful sensor detections on a given contact, showing who detected it and how. Example: https://i.imgur.com/aEmfJnq.png</p> <p>Clicking on the sensor name brings up the DB viewer page of the carrier platform and highlights the sensor stats. Clicking on the detector platform name selects the platform and centers the map on it.</p> <p>This can be quite useful in situations where it is not clear which of multiple units actually detected a contact (e.g. a surface group tracking a target) or in cases where it is desirable to understand which of multiple different sensors can actually hold the contact (quite common e.g. in submarine &amp; ASW operations).</p> <p>-New feature: Mark Contact Position, accessible by right clicking on the contact and selecting \"mark contact position\". It's useful for determining possible locations of uncertain contacts tracked over a long period of time.</p> <p>-New Throttle/Altitude Window feature for ships and submarines-avoid cavitation. If enabled, the AI crew will move slowly enough to prevent noisy cavitation. It is ignored if the ship is avoiding a weapon (after all, it's already found and engine noise is the least of its worries)</p> <p>-Users can now create circular areas of reference points in addition to the older rectangular ones. With CTRL-right click, there is now a \"define area - circle\" option in addition to the \"define area - rectangle\"</p> <p>-New feature: weapon re-attacks. All torpedoes with terminal guidance and several modern ASMs have reattack capability (if they have it, it is marked as such in their database entry). Reattacking is possible if they are successfully jammed/decoyed just prior to impact, or if they fail their hit-or-miss check. In the latter case, the weapon must also pass a reliability check, with the chance of a dud being \u00bc of the original PoH.</p> <p>(For example, a torpedo attacks with a PoH of 80% and misses. The weapon can re-attack, but must first pass a reliability check with a 20% chance of failing (80% * 0.25). If the check fails, the torpedo is a dud. If the check succeeds, the torpedo can proceed to re-attack either the same target or anyone else it acquires.)</p> <p>If the weapon is eligible for re-attack, it passes right over/under the target and begins a spiral search until it is able to re-acquire a target (or runs out of fuel).</p> <p>-New feature: Torpedo wire breaking. If a submarine conducts a \"crash\" turn (1.25 times faster than its standard turn, used only for weapon evasion) or is moving faster than ten knots while firing the torpedoes, there's a chance of the guidance wires breaking and the launched torpedoes becoming autonomous.</p> <p>-New feature: Cargo pickup. Currently works only with aircraft (helicopters and VTOLs), and is manual-ordered only (no mission-driven behaviors as yet). To perform it, right-click on a suitable aircraft and select \"Select unit(s) for pickup\". The cursor will change to a targeting crosshair and you can select one or more target units from which to pick up cargo-type mounts, if they have (for example, to order a helicopter to pick troops from a mobile ground unit). Once it has picked up cargo, the aircraft can be ordered to RTB, and upon landing it will unload the cargo to its host unit.</p> <p>-New feature: \"Flaming datum\". When a ship is hit by a completely undetected torpedo, an underwater \"probable sub\" contact is generated at the point of impact, giving any available ASW units a place to start looking.</p> <p>-Ferry missions can now be used for ships and submarines.</p> <p>-Improvements in submarine damage model. Now only shaped-charge warheads (on certain modern torpedoes) can penetrate underwater submarines. Normal explosives do more realistic shock damage from detonating close to the hull.</p> <p>-New ScenEdit feature: \"Chance of appearance\" (Right click on unit in ScenEdit --&gt; Scenario Editor --&gt; Chance of appearance). This allows setting easily the chance of a unit actually showing up on the next scenario load (at normal-play mode). Units that fail the appearance check are discarded permanently. Applies to platforms only (not weapons).</p> <p>-When exporting facilities using .inst files, boats berthed in these facilities are retained. This is makes it easy to preserve nominal fleet ORBATs for specific historical periods (e.g. which ships were berthed in Norfolk on June 15, 2006).</p> <p>-Min/Max target range for ships/subs/facilities/land-units on strike mission (e.g. \"intercept and engage only targets within 200nm of your position\"), similar to the previous \"tethers\" used for aircraft at their bases.</p> <p>-The mission editor can now define how many aircraft in a patrol will investigate &amp; engage contacts, as well as wingmen behavior. This is to prevent \"contact pileups\" where, for example, a single unidentified aircraft would into the patrol/prosecution area, causing every fighter on patrol to just drop everything and scream towards it.</p> <p>-Configuration files (*.ini) are now automatically consolidated at the [CMANO]\\Config folder for easier management.</p> <p>Version 1.15 (March 2019)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>This update included tweaks to visual/IR sensors to make them more realistically imprecise, a dynamic order of battle window, a personal persistent map option (use at your own risk), and changes in BVR doctrine (see 3.3.12 Unit/Group Doctrine on page 38)</p> <p>-Personal Persistent Map Settings:</p> <p>As we previously saw, the various map information and visibility settings (which layers to display, which range rings/wedges to show, misc. information such as targeting and illumination lines etc.) are set individually for each side in a scenario. This makes sense from a scenario design viewpoint, since each side may have different priorities depending on its overall operational tasking (e.g. prefer underwater sensor and weapon rings if conducting ASW operations). This does mean, however, that if a player prefers to apply his own custom settings at the start of a scenario, he has to do this at the start of each new game session. (Settings are automatically persisted &amp; applied when resuming from a save to continue an ongoing session).</p> <p>This situation has led to one of the biggest user complaints/requests, ever since the v1.0 release of Command, to be \"I am tired of setting my own custom map settings every time I start a scenario anew. Can we get an option to persist my custom settings and automatically apply them into any scenario I start playing?\"</p> <p>We explained why this could be a bad idea (for example, it's an excellent way to miss potentially important information that the scenario author has laid out for the player's attention), but the request remained constant. So we obliged, and it is now possible to do precisely that.</p> <p>Let us see how this works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>To begin with, set up your map preferences just how you like them -     range rings, targeting &amp; illumination vectors, datalinks, reference     points, sonobuoys, datablocks etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open the \"Game Options\" window, go to the \"Map Display\" tab.     There, you will notice a checkbox labelled \"Use personal map     preferences\" and a button labelled \"Save current map profile as     personal\":</p> </li> <li> <p>Clicking on \"Save current map profile as personal\" will make the     current active map profile your personal, persistent one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Checking the \"Use personal map preferences\" will enforce usage of     your persistent map profile. From now on, whichever scenario you     load and whichever side you switch to, the map profile settings in     effect will be those of the persistent one.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To stop using the personal persistent profile, simply uncheck the \"Use personal map preferences\" checkbox. The map display will immediately revert to using the settings that the scenario author offers as default for the scenario &amp; side at hand.</p> <p>-Dynamic Order Of Battle Window. The \"List by group\" page of the ORBAT window is now dynamic, i.e. it automatically refreshes as units are added or destroyed, take off, land, deploy or re-dock to their parent, join or leave a group etc. This makes it possible to keep the ORBAT window continuously open as a \"running tally\" (and quick-jump source) of friendly forces during a scenario, instead of a static snapshot.</p> <p>-IR and visual sensors can now only generate precise contacts at short range, removing the old, unrealistic feature where a visual spotter could see an aircraft and instantly know its exact position.</p> <p>-Finally resolved the long-standing issue of \"blind AMRAAM shots\":</p> <ul> <li> <p>Units firing AAW ARH weapons (e.g. AMRAAM) must now actively detect the target on their own radar before being able to fire the weapon (i.e. it's no longer enough to receive offboard contact from e.g. AWACS and fire based purely on that). This makes it much more challenging to employ AMRAAM-class weapons against stealthy targets or in a heavy-OECM environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>After launching an AMRAAM-class weapon, the unit must still keep detecting the contact in order to provide mid-course guidance to the missile. If radar contact is lost for more than 5 seconds, the missile goes into a \"blind\" state and flies straight ahead (similar to SARH weapons who lose guidance). (Appropriate AI/EMCON logic has been added to encourage this).</p> </li> </ul> <p>-Note that CEC-capable weapons such as AIM-120Ds can be launched \"blindly\" provided there is another appropriate unit to guide them.</p> <p>-BVR Engagement Logic doctrine settings.</p> <p>This changes the doctrine aircraft will follow when engaging with long-range missiles. The three choices are as follows:</p> <p>-Follow missile straight-in: The aircraft will continue to follow the missile straight towards the foe. This can be used to simulate a unit with rigid doctrine, poor training, and/or a desire to close to visual range quickly.</p> <p>-Crank if possible (DEFAULT): The aircraft will \"crank\" by tilting to the edge of its guidance radar and slowing down. This symbolizes a desire and training to stay at long range if possible.</p> <p>-Crank and drag: The aircraft will not only crank but will, once the missile goes active and its guidance is no longer necessary, \"drag\" and move away from the target. This symbolizes a greater desire to stay at long range at any cost as well as the skill to do so.</p> <p>-Updated South China Sea terrain data.</p> <p>-The diesel \"noise penalty\" for snorkeling submarines is now gradual and dependent on the speed of the submarine. Not surprisingly, stationary subs are very quiet while rapidly moving subs are very loud.</p> <p>Version 1.15.6</p> <p>Major changes to MAD (Magnetic Anomaly Detector) sensor modelling.</p> <p>-- MADs are no longer precision sensors, they have bearing ambiguity and absolutely no range estimate (the range estimate is essentially \"anywhere from right in front of us up to max sensor range\")</p> <p>-- The practical MAD detection range is affected by the displacement ratio (target displacement vs max reference figure) and under-keel depth (shallow is worse, because of the bottom background)</p> <p>-- MAD scan rates have been increased (only in DB3000 v478+). This rewards faster sensor platforms (e.g. P-8 vs P-3 vs helicopter) as they are able to cover more distance per given time and thus refine the contact position through triangulation faster.</p> <p>Version 2.0</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>COMMAND Version 2.0, or Command: Modern Operations, is the official sequel to Command, containing a completely revamped engine.</p> <p>User Interface</p> <ul> <li>General user interface: The entire UI has been renovated on a dark   theme with emphasis on improved usability</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>New, high-resolution map layers:</p> </li> <li> <p>Sentinel-2 Cloudless (2016):     https://s2maps.eu/</p> </li> <li> <p>BMNGv2 (improved version of NASA's Blue Marble NG)</p> </li> <li> <p>Relief-90: High resolution land-only overlay</p> </li> <li> <p>Stamen Terrain (     http://maps.stamen.com/terrain     )</p> </li> <li> <p>Stamen Roads &amp; Cities (     http://maps.stamen.com/terrain-lines     )</p> </li> <li> <p>Terrain land-cover type (Example:     https://i.imgur.com/NNmb2Wx.jpg     )</p> </li> <li> <p>Message Log 2.0: A radically improved message reporting system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additional unit-level message log: All messages relevant to a     specific unit are aggregated on a window specific to this unit and     only optionally also shown on the side-level message log. This both     declutters the main message log and makes it much easier to quickly     examine a unit's message history.</p> </li> <li> <p>Message balloons: When an event happens on the main map, a     \"balloon\" containing the message pops up for \\~10 sec. This makes     it immediately obvious where the event described is happening. The     balloons appear at a random bearing and semi-random distance from     the reported event, to avoid overlapping on top of each other. They     stay visible for 5 seconds, then fade out.     The appearance or not of the balloons is configurable per message     type (Game Options \u2192 Message Log).</p> </li> <li> <p>The side-level message log groups reported messages by type, and     highlights the unread ones. This makes it easy to prioritize reading     important messages (e.g. weapon engagements, battle damage etc.) and     quickly catch up on unread traffic:     https://i.imgur.com/mpVkKF6.png</p> </li> <li> <p>When clicking any of the messages on the interactive message log,     the map will auto-center on the message origin location.</p> </li> <li> <p>Messages are type-color coded, both on the message log and in the     balloons. Example:     https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285833706273243138/451754006797352960/xFzgVmF.png</p> </li> <li> <p>When used in detached mode, the interactive message log can also     switch to the \"classic v1\" raw-text style and back again, by     clicking on the \"Switch to [other style]\" button:</p> </li> </ul> <p>https://i.imgur.com/G2Eof7L.png</p> <p>https://i.imgur.com/H5PBcpu.png</p> <ul> <li> <p>Players no longer need to manually download and install the unit image   packs; images are now automatically downloaded on-demand and displayed   when a respective unit is selected.</p> </li> <li> <p>The map engine has been re-written almost from scratch, to offer a   fast, smooth-flowing pan &amp; zoom experience.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: A series of shortcut buttons are available under the main   menu, to provide quick navigation to most common commands and windows.   These can be toggled on/off by the \"Show/Hide Shortcuts\" button:   https://i.imgur.com/tT8KhD0.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: The \"Evaluation &amp; Scoring\" window now has a \"Scoring   Graph\" tab, where the player can witness the change of the side score   over time, along with the reason for the changes. Example:   https://i.imgur.com/ulmYdux.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: throttle/altitude shortcut buttons on right column:   https://i.imgur.com/kojiBTA.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI feature: Contacts list on the ORBAT window:   https://i.imgur.com/iPNPEu6.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: \"Edit hosted boats\" and \"Edit hosted AC\" shortcut   buttons in unit status panel. These are visible only in ScenEdit mode   (and as applicable, e.g. a platform will no air facilities will not   display the \"Edit hosted AC\" button), and allow you to directly jump   to the relevant windows:   https://i.imgur.com/Jd7o1VR.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI tweak: When selecting a group member on the group-status panel (for   a mobile group only, not land installation), instead of displaying the   DB entry for the unit, the map now selects and centers on this unit   and switches to unit-view if necessary. This makes it easier to   quickly jump into a specific unit from group-view.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: Keyword search on ORBAT window. This works similarly to   web browsers, i.e. as you type the desired keyword, entries matching   are highlighted:   https://i.imgur.com/NLI3ZaW.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Map/UI addition: Show list of currently selected friendly units   grouped by class/type, similar to Homeworld. Example:   https://i.imgur.com/F2eJqKj.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI addition: It is now possible to have multiple windows of the   DB-viewer open concurrently</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI tweak: The throttle/altitude window (aka F2 window) more clearly   distinguishes between having selected a waypoint of a unit's plotted   course or the unit itself.</li> </ul> <p>Example with waypoint selected: https://i.imgur.com/2Sfo3nS.png</p> <p>Example with the unit itself selected: https://i.imgur.com/zNMyuBX.png</p> <p>Also, by using the white \"previous\" and \"next\" arrows next to the unit/waypoint description, it is possible to select the previous/next waypoint or the unit itself without leaving this window.</p> <ul> <li>New UI feature: The right column (unit status etc.) can now slide   in/out of the main window.</li> </ul> <p>How it works: There is now a collapse/expand button next to the right column: https://i.imgur.com/v2rR8xj.png</p> <p>Clicking the button will cause the right column to slide out of view: https://i.imgur.com/z4nhUpv.png</p> <p>Clicking the button again restores the right column as normal.</p> <p>This can be useful if the left side of the main window is taken up by UI elements (e.g. message log &amp; 3D-view) and this way the player can use more map area.</p> <ul> <li> <p>New UI feature: Time-step buttons:   https://i.imgur.com/Lx7MdCQ.png   . Clicking on any of these (while paused) will advance the simulation   time forward by 15 sec, 1 min, 5 mins or 15 mins, and then stop again.   The key combinations Alt + 1/2/3/4 are mapped to the 15 sec, 1 min, 5   min and 15 min timesteps respectively. This makes it possible to   control time-flow without having the mouse cursor leave the area of   interest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Map/UI tweak: When clicking on a stack of units/contacts on the map, a   new menu pops up allowing selection of the specific desired unit.   Example:   https://i.imgur.com/2ZTADQn.png   . This is designed to avoid the need for extreme close-up on a map   location just to select a unit.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI window: Line of sight (LOS) Tool. The LOS tool offers a new   capability for visualizing sensor LOS of a given platform or an   arbitrary geopoint.</li> </ul> <p>To use it, select the desired platform, then on the main menu, click on Editor LOS Tool. The LOS-Tool window will appear, and the shaded area representing the platform's current LOS will be rendered on the map.</p> <p>There are various settings we can change on the tool:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Max distance (nm): This is the maximum distance for which the LOS   coverage will be calculated. Increasing this can have a major impact   on map-refresh performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Target Alt (m AGL): This is the assumed target altitude for which the   LOS coverage is calculated. This can be very useful is we want to   visualize LOS against, for example, an airborne threat at a specific   above-ground altitude (\"show radar coverage against an F-111   terrain-following at 60m\"). If the \"Same as observer\" checkbox is   ticked, then the LOS calculations assume a target as the exact same   altitude as the selected platform.</p> </li> <li> <p>Horizon type: This is Radar/ESM by default but may be switched to   Visual instead. The EM horizon is somewhat longer than the strict   visual horizon and this affects LOS coverage as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shade Color: The color of the shade coverage can be altered, to avoid   interference with other map elements.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>New map feature: If you zoom low enough to a naval vessel (ship/sub),   you can see its proportional size at it would be really seen at that   camera altitude. Example:   https://i.imgur.com/JjEmgGR.png</p> </li> <li> <p>New map feature: Aircraft range rings. Like with weapons, rings that   show the theoretical maximum range of a given aircraft can be enabled   or disabled.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Map tweak: When displaying an area/course-based mission (on map) also   display the mission name.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Map tweak: Long lines (e.g. intercontinental plotted courses) now   follow the correct great-circle (i.e. curved) path.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI feature: Minimaps. There are 3 types: Global (entire planet),   Scenario (fits to the scenario's units) and Camera-Following.   Different types can be used concurrently. For example:   https://i.imgur.com/XrorOAJ.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI option: Full-screen view for main window (View --&gt;   Full-screen view), ON by default. The shortcut key for toggling this   is Alt+Enter. This setting is persisted across game sessions.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI feature: Hover-info box. If the user holds down the CTRL key   while hovering the cursor over a unit, group or contact, a box pops up   with summary information on the object of interest. Example:   https://i.imgur.com/qbDdlc9.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>New UI feature: Open recent scen/save files:   https://i.imgur.com/IIETZiu.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>UI tweak: Steam Workshop scenarios are now accessed on a separate tab   in the \"Load Scenario\" window:   https://i.imgur.com/0y9sonw.png</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Added support for real-time visualization using Tacview (IMPORTANT NOTE: To use this feature, you must purchase Tacview Advanced or   Enterprise edition) . How to use:</li> </ul> <p>1)  Purchase &amp; download Tacview (https://www.tacview.net/ ) and     install.</p> <p>2)  The \"Game Options\" window a dedicated \"Tacview\" tab, for setting     the path to the Tacview executable. Make sure you set the correct     path in order to make it work. (The path is saved together with the     other game preferences)</p> <p>3)  Load up a scenario as usual, and then click on View --&gt; 3D View. A     secondary window should appear, with Tacview's default top-down     view. You can focus on any unit, either by clicking it on the     Command map as usual, or by Ctrl+LMB on the Tacview window itself.     The mouse scroll zooms in/out just like Command, whereas using     mouse-grab you can rotate the camera around the focused unit.</p> <p>Tacview is fairly sparse in models and terrain out of the box, but can be significantly enhanced with add-ons.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To add extra models: First, construct a suitable 3D mesh and place it   in the proper folder (see here for instructions:   https://www.tacview.net/documentation/3dobjects/en/ . Afterwards,   edit the Excel file   [CMANO]\\Resources\\Tacview\\Associations_DB3000.xls and add a new   row in the relevant sheet with at least the DBID and mesh file name of   the object. Command will then read the entry and provide the filename   to Tacview to render the object. (This currently possible only for   DB3000 units)</p> </li> <li> <p>To add more detailed elevation data &amp; textures, see instructions here:   https://www.tacview.net/documentation/terrain/en/. We are currently   putting together a global-scale SRTM3 dataset (elevations) but imagery   layers are a tougher proposition.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The window hosting the Tacview display has the same common properties as other CMANO secondary windows, so it can be moved around, resized etc. Two example configurations are:</p> <p>Single monitor: https://i.imgur.com/PqnPYJm.png</p> <p>Two monitors: https://i.imgur.com/O7sjbS7.jpg</p> <ul> <li>New UI feature: Personal persistent map profile (i.e. maintain the   same map preferences throughout different scenarios &amp; sides,   effectively overriding the scenario author's default settings).</li> </ul> <p>How it works:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set up your map preferences just how you like them - range rings,   targeting &amp; illumination vectors, datalinks, reference points,   sonobuoys, datablocks etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open the \"Game Options\" window, go to the \"Map Display\" tab. There   you will find two new UI elements: https://i.imgur.com/MyKYwpp.png</p> </li> <li> <p>Clicking on \"Save current map profile as personal\" will make the   current active map profile your personal, persistent one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Checking the \"Use personal map preferences\" will enforce usage of   your persistent map profile. From now on, whichever scenario you load   and whichever side you switch to, the map profile settings in effect   will be those of the persistent one.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To stop using the personal persistent profile, simply uncheck the \"Use personal map preferences\" checkbox. The map display will immediately revert to using the settings that the scenario author offers as default for the scenario &amp; side at hand.</p> <ul> <li>UI tweak: The \"contact status\" panel now also display's the   contact's WRA-type information:   https://i.imgur.com/0vPkYJh.png</li> </ul> <p>This helps to better understand AI decisions on WRA-driven weapon allocations (e.g. \"why are my planes shooting 8 instead of 2 Harpoons at this ship contact?\")</p> <ul> <li>New map option: Colored datablocks. Configurable through \"Game Options   --&gt; Map Display\". When enabled, a unit/contact's datablock will have   the color corresponding to its posture (e.g. red if hostile).</li> </ul> <p>General gameplay &amp; content</p> <ul> <li>New gameplay mode: Quick Battle Generator (aka \"Command MadLibs\").   The QBG offers players a way to quickly jump into a battle without   much preparation or wider geopolitical factors. The player selects the   template of the quick battle he wants to create, alters the settings   provided by the HTML page, and clicks on \"START\".</li> </ul> <p>Quick-battle templates are stored in subfolders inside the [CMANO]\\QuickBattle folder. Each template consists of a simple HTML page and a matching Lua file.</p> <p>\"Behind the scenes\", the values of the named HTML elements in the template pages are translated to matching Lua variables with the same name, and provided to the template's Lua script file which is then executed, generating the quick battle.</p> <p>The framework is constructed specifically so that players can make their own templates and share them with others, just like with regular scenarios.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The features previously available only to \"Chains Of War\" and related   DLCs (Comms disruption, detailed aircraft damage, cargo/ambip/airdrop   operations and advanced weapon types) are now integrated into the base   game and available to all players.</p> </li> <li> <p>New music soundtrack and sound effects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Brand-new scenarios by Paul Bridge (Sirius) and other community   contributors.</p> </li> <li> <p>All original official v1.x scenarios have been remastered by Rory   Noonan (Apache85) to take advantage of new v1.x and v2.0 features.</p> </li> <li> <p>An extensive range of tutorials (some new, some carried over from   Command v1.x) to ease in new players into the intricacies of modern   operations. There are now three full tutorial sets for each major   branch of operations (air, surface, underwater), plus dedicated   tutorials for specific aspects of the game.</p> </li> <li> <p>The default map icon style is now \"Directional\", to present new   players with more familiar icons representing various unit types. The   \"NTDS/APP-6\" and \"Stylized\" type options remain available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Includes the latest versions of the DB3000 and CWDB databases.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Simulation &amp; mechanics</p> <ul> <li>Simulation performance &amp; scalability has been significantly enhanced.   This is most evident in large or complex scenarios.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Major new simulation feature: Terrain types.</li> </ul> <p>The different types of terrain are now accurately represented, using NASA's MODIS Land-Cover 2012 dataset</p> <p>(More details: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mcd12q)</p> <p>The various terrain types have different effects on the mobility of ground units, on weapon effects (especially blast and frag warheads) and spotting visibility. In summary:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Water is impassable</p> </li> <li> <p>Wetlands reduce speed to 10% of original (bog!), and impair visibility   slightly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snow/Ice reduce speed to 20% of original, and impair visibility   slightly.</p> </li> <li> <p>All forest types reduce speed to 30% of original, significantly hamper   the destructive effect of blast and fragmentation detonations, and   sharply reduce spotting ranges.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shrublands reduce speed to 50% of original, slightly reduce the blast   &amp; frag effects, and moderately reduce visibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Croplands and vegetation mosaics reduce speed to 70% of original, and   slightly reduce visibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open and wooded savannas reduce speed to 80% of original</p> </li> <li> <p>Barren / sparsely vegetated terrain and grasslands have no impact on   speed, weapons or visibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Urban &amp; built-up terrain increases speed to 110% of original, but   severely block both weapons and visibility.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The land-type information is displayed on the map-cursor blackbox, next to terrain slope info.</p> <ul> <li>New optional scenario realism option: Realistic Sub Comms. When   enabled, submarines who go below 40m depth go off the communications   grid. The player can, at any time, send a \"bell-ringer\" ELF signal   to a no-comms submarine to recall it to re-establish comms   (right-click on sub icon, click on \"Summon to re-establish comms\").   The sub will attempt to rise to shallow depth to rejoin (this may not   be immediate, as it will try to evade nearby hostiles). Once it   rejoins, the sub will share its contact updates with its parent side.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Land units can now resupply from appropriate units (i.e. ammo trucks)   similar to UNREP-capable ships.</li> </ul> <p>The unit can be ordered to resupply via the \"replenish/refuel if necessary\" command on the right click window. Once the supply vehicle is found/directed to, it will pull up alongside it and stop, with weapons being gradually transferred over.</p> <ul> <li>Land units now perform pathfinding during their navigation. The   movement cost takes into account both terrain slope (pre-existing) and   land-cover type (new). The combination of these factors generates the   navigation route.</li> </ul> <p>This is an example, with an M60 tank platoon at southern Attica ordered to move to the northeast of the peninsula: https://i.imgur.com/VtqRzVZ.png . The unit selects the displayed path both to avoid the surrounding mountain ridges (red ellipses) and to maximize its mobility, going through the urban area instead of the croplands to the east.</p> <ul> <li>Significant change in unit AI logic: The \"evaluate targets\" and   \"evaluate threats\" logics are now not performed on every pulse, but   instead on regular intervals dictated by the OODA-Targeting (modified   by crew proficiency) and OODA-Evasion values respectively.</li> </ul> <p>This has two effects:</p> <ol> <li> <p>These two OODA values, and crew proficiency, become even more     critical to a unit's effectiveness and survivability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Because these AI parts are called less frequently (and they are     among the top CPU-killers), overall sim-core performance in     large/complex scenarios is significantly improved.</p> </li> <li> <p>IR and visual sensors can now generate precise detections only at   short ranges.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Specifically:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Visual sensors make a precise detection only at distances shorter than   twice the max classification zoom level of the sensor (e.g. if an   aircraft can be visually classified at 5nm by a visual sensor, all   detections at longer than 10nm will be imprecise). The range ambiguity   at long range is 10% of the detection range (e.g. if a detection is   made at 20nm, the range ambiguity will be +/- 2nm)</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-imaging IR sensors make a precise detection only at distances   shorter than the max classification zoom level of the sensor (e.g. if   an aircraft can be classified at 5nm by an IRST, all detections at   longer than 5nm will be imprecise). The range ambiguity at long range   is 50% of the detection range (plain IRSTs are really bad at providing   range estimates).</p> </li> <li> <p>Imaging IR sensors are significantly more capable than their   non-imaging counterparts. Like visuals, they generate a precise   detection at distances shorter than twice the max classification zoom   level, and their range ambiguity is 20% of the detection range.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Aircraft and surface-launched missiles now use the same improved pitch   kinematics as air-launched missiles (i.e. smoother climbs/dives).</p> </li> <li> <p>Lofted AAW missiles now begin their terminal dive earlier, to avoid a   too-steep approach to the target.</p> </li> <li> <p>NEW: Improved, cost-based pathfinding logic. Ships now plot more   realistic courses around islands, straits etc. and avoid \"surfing\"   (coming too close to shore unnecessarily).</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerous tweaks to aircraft flight model, specifically for \"combat\"   conditions. For example, aircraft no longer \"wiggle\" between   headings as they must first roll towards the turn direction before   committing to a turn. This in turn makes roll-rate much more critical   to close air combat maneuvers. This is easier to observe in the   Tacview window.</p> </li> <li> <p>New radar model factor: Frequency agility. Frequency-agile radars get   two major benefits; they are more resistant to noise jamming and they   are significantly less affected by doppler notching (see below).   Mechanical-scan radars that are frequency agile have this flag on   their DB values. All PESA and AESA radars are assumed to be   frequency-agile.</p> </li> <li> <p>Doppler notching is now actively used as a maneuver, both for missile   avoidance and for general radar detection avoidance. Aircraft can   attempt to fly perpendicular to an emitter using doppler filtering in   order to hide inside its \"blind\" velocity gate. The effectiveness of   the maneuver varies with crew skill (an \"ace\" pilot will execute it   far more effectively than a novice), to discourage manual   micromanagement. Aircraft under missile attack with a doppler radar   guiding the missile will also actively try to beam the radar instead   of the missile (the geometry of the two axes can vary significantly).   The maneuver is ineffective against pulse-only radars and less   effective against frequency-agile radars.</p> </li> <li> <p>Air combat AI improvement: Aircraft now consider approaching   fighters/interceptors as imminent threat, not just missiles. This   helps AI-controlled aircraft perform more proactive evasive maneuvers   against fighters about to perform gun attacks on them (e.g. MiG-17 vs   F-105).</p> </li> <li> <p>New air combat feature: Pilot G-tolerance (a.k.a. \"how to resolve the   \"fighters pulling hard turns indefinitely\" realism flaw\").</p> </li> </ul> <p>When an aircraft is considered to be performing \"combat maneuvers\", an extra UI element is shown on unit status panel: https://i.imgur.com/odY2E8O.png</p> <p>This represents the crew's tolerance to hard maneuvering. The longer the aircraft is continuously pulling a hard turn, the more this buffer fills up. (Getting out of a hard maneuver, e.g. reversing a turn, reduces this strain. This is one of the reasons that scissors are a popular practice in RL dogfights.)</p> <p>Once the tolerance is exhausted, the crew begin suffering G-LOC and have to significantly relax the turn (this is easier to notice in Tacview, but you should also observe a noticeably larger turn radius on the top-down view) while regaining their senses and control of the aircraft. Of course the aircraft is particularly more vulnerable during this recovery period.</p> <p>-New patrol mission option: Repeated loop. This allows units on patrol to take exact patterns (similar to support missions) when not engaged offensively.</p> <ul> <li>When a unit re-joins the comms grid, the sim now provides much more   fine-grained feedback on what type of information was updated for a   contact (if any), and skips mentioning contact merges that produce no   new info.</li> </ul> <p>Scenario Editor &amp; Scripting</p> <ul> <li>New ScenEdit feature: Merge scenarios into a single one (Editor --&gt;   Merge Scenarios). Scenario #1 is treated as the \"base\" for the   merge, so behind the scenes you are essentially cherry-picking all   transferable items from scen #2 and adding them to scen #1 (the log   output also makes this clear). Elements that are \"atomic\" or   otherwise hard to merge (date &amp; time, weather, title &amp; description   etc.) will, on the output, be those of scenario #1.</li> </ul> <p>Version 2.1 (Command Modern Operations V 1.01)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <ul> <li> <p>A significant number of new official Tacview models included (see   12.8 Tacview on page 299).</p> </li> <li> <p>Terrain type legend added (see 6.5 Map Settings Drop-Down Menu on   page 125)</p> </li> <li> <p>15x time acceleration added (see 3.1.1 The Globe Display on page   12)</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerous speed/performance enhancement features, as well as bug fixes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tacview no longer displays all units of all sides automatically,   adding a proper fog of war mode.</p> </li> <li> <p>Major ABM performance enhancements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Changed the shade of red displayed to stand out more easily against   dark backgrounds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mission AI tweak: For non-specific mission types, the default \"start   looking for tankers\" fuel threshold has been changed from 60% to 30%.   This helps alleviate cases where aircraft nearing their strike targets   abruptly turn back and start looking for a suitable tanker to refuel.</p> </li> <li> <p>In-game sounds/music now have adjustable volume (see 6.4.4 Sounds   and Music on page 125)</p> </li> <li> <p>Numerous database updates.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Version 2.2 (Command Modern Operations V 1.02)</p>"},{"location":"update-history/#cmo-v102-release-notes","title":"CMO v1.02 Release Notes","text":"<p>* Additional significant improvements to mine warfare: - Map shows the connection (a line) between the mine and who is clearing it. - The sweep from a ship starts offset from the unit location, to simulate the sweep hanging back from the stern. This pushes back the mine explosions as they are caught in the sweep. - MCM gear can have a delay factor to when it can become active. - Improved actions for MCM-oriented torpedoes like Seafox, so they can look for new mines if they miss the initial target mine - Pathfinding on mine-clearing mission is improved so as to not to spend too long finding paths. If a mine is detected in the path to the next waypoint, the path is shortened rather than recalculated. This gives a better flow to the mission. - Units can be given a set of waypoints to follow, and the unit will attempt to follow this path while diverting to clear any mines within range. - Mine-hunting torpedoes will be automatically fired against bottom and rising mines (which cannot be swept). This compromise has been made because a unit might fire the whole magazine against the first lot of mines detected, despite being able to sweep them normally. This does not stop the user from manually firing the torpedo using standard BOL. - MCM gear is not immediately available when a ship turns unless the turn angle is small; this simulates the disruption to the sweep as it straightens out again (one cause of previous issues with sweeping was that the sweep was always active even during sharp turns, which meant a ship could set off multiple mines as it swing around, causing lots of damage to itself). - Aircraft OTOH quickly correct the sweep, but they fly an arc which can put them out of position for the mine they are after. They will try to self-correct and aim closer to the target mine; however this may not happen immediately. As the sweep is active, they could sweep mines that fall under their sweeps so the multiple attempts to line up the mine is counter by this. - Ships will tend to back away from any other ships performing mine clearing operations. The sweep will be 'turned off' in these cases so as not to set off mines in that location.</p> <p>Even though the mine clearing mission has been cleaned up to help minimize damages, this is a risky business for ships and severe damage can still happen.</p> <p>* Improvement to 4K-Fix tool (prevents null-reference exception). * Added support for CWDB in the Quick-Battle Generator. You can now specify which DB to employ in a QBG template, by using a 'hidden'-type HTML element. Examples: \\&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"DB\" value=\"DB3000\"&gt; or \\&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"DB\" value=\"CWDB\"&gt; . This element must be present in the Form.html file in the template folder. If it is not present, the QBG defaults to using the DB3000 database. * Added: [Lua] VP_GetScenario method (Exposes some scenario data such as duration, start time, complexity &amp; difficulty, DB file used etc.)</p> <p>(Command Modern Operations V 1.03)</p> <p>v1.03 - Build 1147.23 Release Notes ==================================================================</p> <p>Major changes to sonar model, full description here:\u00a0https://ftp.matrixgames.com/pub/Command ... HANGES.pdf Summary of changes: - The thermocline layer is generally weaker then before for a given location, and completely stops being effective at 70+ degrees north or south latitude. - The minimum bottom depth necessary to achieve converge zone (CZ) propagation is sharply increased per given location, and is no longer static but dependent on latitude. CZs are now also impossible at 70+ degrees north or south latitude. - Most under-layer sonars (SOSUS/SURTASS excluded) lose the 2x detection range bonus afforded by the deep sound channel. This sharply reduces the in-DSC detection ranges of VDS &amp; towed arrays.</p> <p>* Certain IRST/FLIR systems can now produce AAW fire control-grade data, allowing EMCON-silent engagements with AMRAAM-class weapons (relevant discussion:\u00a0https://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=4886491\u00a0). Note that the fire-control data generated by advanced IRSTs can be used not only for direct onboard shooting (e.g. F-18E uses IRST-21 to silently shoot AMRAAMs at target) but it can also be distributed to other platforms via CEC (e.g. F-18E silently tracks target, hands off to CEC-equipped ship which silently shoots SM-6 at target). These are the sensors in DB3000 v488 that have this ability:\u00a0[https://i.imgur.com/ZclxXYD.png</p> <p>](https://i.imgur.com/ZclxXYD.png)* ADDED: Visual and IR checks are now also susceptible to look-down clutter. For example it is easier for an IRST (or the plain Mk1 Eyeball) to pick out an aircraft over the horizon line than against the surface background.</p> <p>* Datalink + TARH AAW missiles (e.g. AMRAAM, SM-6 etc.) can now go active without immediately going autonomous (this allows such missiles to be guided with greater precision &amp; reliability against VLO targets or in strong OECM environment). The datalink is cut instead only when the missile acquires the target (or impacts on it, still under positive control from the link provider).</p> <p>* TWEAK: Minelaying changes: 1. Don't drop mines until the first WP is reached rather than drop as soon as hits area. 2. Allow a path to be set from the first WP so a pattern of mines can be laid.

To enable the 'auto-filter', select the type of contact from the dropdown list and left-click; a tick mark will be shown if it is enabled. You can only select neutral biological and civilian contacts at the moment. If the contact turns hostile or unfriendly, it will turn off the contact's filter out flag.</p> <p>* ADDED: When a weapon record is multi-packed (e.g. 4x ESSMs on single Mk41 cell), display this information on DB-viewer and \"Weapons\" window (Example:\u00a0https://i.imgur.com/7JDIAJ2.png)</p> <p>* ADDED: Aircraft baseline (colored green) and loadout-specific RCS signatures shown in DB-viewer.</p> <p>* FIXED: \"Red-X\" problem after resuming from OS sleep/hibernate/screen lock</p> <p>* Various SAR/CSAR improvements: - Added CSAR role to aircraft (in addition to SAR) - Check range to pick up - Do pickup of cargo OR SAR-eligible unit (any unit could be so picked up leading to lost units) - Eligible units need to have Lua ScenEdit_SetUnit(\"CSAR\") - The \"unit\" Lua wrapper now has a WasPickedUp property to indicate if it has been picked up</p> <p>* ADDED: #14548 Add UI option to edit ship/submarine/facility fuel levels:\u00a0https://imgur.com/C4o9yI7 * ADDED: \"Sub-type\" filter on DB viewer * ADDED: #14505: Fire and Flood should be able to be edited through the GUI * ADDED: #14547 - Different escort response distances for fighters and SEAD aircraft * ADDED: #14564: Mission Editor option: Avoid Cavitation * ADDED: #14564: [Lua] Avoid Cavitation option (\"AVOIDCAVITATION\" parameter on ScenEdit_SetUnit, plus \"avoidCavitation\" property on \"unit\" wrapper object) * ADDED: Arc-coverage information for platform mounts &amp; sensors on DB viewer * ADDED: [Lua] Added 'unassign' keyword to SetUnit() and wrapper (Completing un-assigns the unit as if hotkey 'u' was pressed) * ADDED: [Lua] Added ship ready-time, as property on unit wrapper-object and also as parameter (\"TIMETOREADY_MINUTES\") on ScenEdit_SetUnit * Added UI tweaks to \"Set Fuel Quantity and airborne time\" window. * Added missing chaff-rejection effectiveness values for Late-1980s &amp; Early-1990s sensors * ADDED: \"Mine countermeasures\" items to \"Damage Control\" window * ADDED: SBR now also records fuel levels for ships and subs * ADDED: [Lua] 'crew' property added to unit wrapper * ADDED: [Lua] 'pitch' &amp; 'groundSpeed' properties to unit wrapper * ADDED: [Lua] Added methods ResetLossExp, ResetScore * ADDED: [Lua] Added property contact.lastDetections * ADDED: [Lua] unit wrapper 'jammed'/'jammer' properties * ADDED: [Lua] unit.airborne_v as numeric seconds * ADDED: [Steam] Ability to change the visibility of workshop items</p> <p>* Tweak: #14606: [Lua] Unit wrapper damage percent reliability * Tweak: #14672: Show warning on the weapon form if usable only by Command-PE * Tweak: #14698: Doctrine Inheritance on Patrol missions - \"Ignore Plotted Course\" setting (If doctrine is inherited and already set to 'yes', don't change it.

(See this page for background:\u00a0https://www.radartutorial.eu/01.basics/ ... ll.en.html\u00a0). If multiple units are located within the resolution cell, the radar will detect only one of them. This feature confers an extra advantage to higher-frequency radar systems, as they are better able to distinguish between closely-clustered targets.</p> <p>* NEW FEATURE:\u00a0Radar vertical scan angle limitations. Radars can only look up/down to a maximum of 30 degrees. This restriction severely curtails their ability to search for targets high above or well under them, and has indeed been used and exploited operationally (Example:\u00a0https://theaviationgeekclub.com/the-sto ... 14-tomcats\u00a0). There is an exception, however: Phased-array radars can scan upwards close to the vertical limit. Satellites are also exempt from this check since they are designed for significant look-down angle.</p> <p>* NEW FEATURE:\u00a0Phased-array radars (PESA/AESA) suffer from gain degradation (hence effective range reduction) when attempting to detect targets far off the antenna boresight, both on the horizontal and vertical plane. This schematic shows the coverage difference between a mechanical-scan set (APG-68(V)9) and two AESA radar options for the F-16:\u00a0https://belisarius21.files.wordpress.co ... eba.-3.png\u00a0. Note the severe drop on high off-boresight detection range on the two AESAs because of the gain reduction. In addition to the changes in the radar code, the difference is also displayed on the map:\u00a0https://i.imgur.com/lB5BXn6.png\u00a0(The \"flower\" coverage pattern on the ship is because of the individual SPY-1 faces, each of which is a PESA antenna). Aircraft with phased-array radars will now crank more conservatively (reduced angle off-target) to compensate for this effect.</p> <p>* ADDED: [Event Editor] Checkbox to show all unit types in target triggers * Tweak: Lower distance to check for localisation change * UI Tweak: \"Speed &amp; Altitude\" window - Missing waypoint type that might be causing exception * TWEAK: \"Ignore plotted course\" setting limited to Patrol mission * TWEAK: Tac-Nukes under semi-active guidance (e.g. nuclear SAMs) detonate if they go blind after travelling half their fly distance (i.e. armed) * TWEAK: #14380 - [GUI] Mission list ordered by alphabetical order * TWEAK: Placing mobile facility in a difficult terrain shows a warning * ADDED: [Tacview] Added support for the MaxFrameRate switch (only on Tacview 1.8.7+) * ADDED: Lua wrapper for Scenario object allows setting scenario Title * ADDED: #14339: Hotkey for \"Define Area\" (Ctrl + K) * ADDED: #13784: GUI QoL 1.1 (Add New Mission) * ADDED: #13787: GUI QoL 1.2 (Mission Editor) * ADDED: Three QoL requests from forum: - Able to sort planes/boats in the air operations/boat operations by ready time / loadout - Ability to hide/show unavailable aircraft on Air-Ops window. - Hangar/dock now show capacity occupied/total capacity (occupied percentage)</p> <p>* Added menu button to delete waypoint and shortcut info * Numerous tweaks &amp; fixes on pathfinder logics, to address reported PF issues. * The practical scenario size limit (in terms of number of units) for consistent saving has been increased. * The integrity check on registered DB files has been improved. * Placed more tactical-AI calculations to run in parallel execution.

This can be useful in modeling the different height placement (and thus horizon coverage, and the now-critical ability to clear the local skyline, see below) for each individual sensor in a platform.</p> <p>In the DB3000 v499, two ship platforms have explicit per-sensor mast-height values:</p> <p>* #2867 - DDG 51 Arleigh Burke [Arleigh Burke Flight I] -- United States (Navy), 2018, DMP, SM-3, AEGIS BMD</p> <p>* #122 - DDG 51 Arleigh Burke [Arleigh Burke Flight I] -- United States (Navy), 1991</p> <p>* NEW MAJOR SIM FEATURE: Terrain type-dependent skyline / land-cover height. The simulation now clearly distinguishes between terrain elevation height (i.e. the actual ground) and the \"skyline\" height outlined by either natural features (forest trees, plantation etc.) or man-made structures (buildings, bridges etc.). This is critical for a number of different sim features, from land close-combat (e.g. land forces need to poke their sensors above local features to get sufficient LOS) to low-level flight (some aircraft can fly between the trees/buildings, most cannot).</p> <p>Several new land-cover types have been added to the existing ones. The overall list of land-cover types and their associated skyline-height values is as follows:</p> <p>Water =&gt; 0</p> <p>Evergreen Needleleaf forest =&gt; 5</p> <p>Evergreen Broadleaf forest =&gt; 5</p> <p>Deciduous Needleleaf forest =&gt; 5</p> <p>Deciduous_Broadleaf forest =&gt; 5</p> <p>Mixed forest =&gt; 5</p> <p>Closed shrublands =&gt; 1</p> <p>Open shrublands =&gt; 1</p> <p>Woody savannas =&gt; 5</p> <p>Savannas =&gt; 1</p> <p>Grasslands =&gt; 1</p> <p>Permanent wetlands =&gt; 1</p> <p>Croplands =&gt; 1</p> <p>Cropland Natural Vegetation Mosaic =&gt; 1</p> <p>Snow And Ice =&gt; 1</p> <p>Barren Or Sparsely Vegetated =&gt; 1</p> <p>Urban And Built Up =&gt; 9</p> <p>Urban - Close Inner City =&gt; 30</p> <p>Urban - Spaced High Rise =&gt; 45</p> <p>Urban - Attached Houses =&gt; 6</p> <p>Urban - Close Industrial =&gt; 9</p> <p>Urban - Spaced Apartments =&gt; 20</p> <p>Urban - Detached Houses =&gt; 6</p> <p>Urban - Spaced Industrial =&gt; 9</p> <p>Urban - Shanty Town =&gt; 4</p> <p>Custom Environment Zone UI changes and new land-cover Types</p> <p>The Custom Environment Zone window UI has been re-arranged, with sonar environment overrides grouped together on one side and land-cover overrides grouped on the other. You can now set a custom land cover height (skyline), which will override the default land cover height for the CEZ:</p> <p></p> <p>The cover type 'Use_Underlying_Values' allows you to create a CEZ that doesn't override land cover at all (for example if you only wanted to override weather and/or sonar conditions.) If you do select a specific land cover type, you can then check the 'Set custom height' checkbox to override the cover height for that CEZ. The height value is in whole meters.</p> <p>Aircraft 'Land Cover Masking' Flight Mode</p> <p>'Land Cover Masking' (aka \"fly between the trees/buildings\") is a new flight mode for aircraft. Only aircraft with the DB capability flag for 'land cover masking' set will be capable of this flight mode (DB v499+ required). In DB3000 v499 all rotorcraft (incl. some UAVs) have this capability.</p> <p>To set an aircraft to use this flight mode you use the Speed/Altitude window to set an aircraft (or aircraft waypoint) to use terrain-following mode. Once you set terrain following (and assuming the aircraft is capable of land-cover masking), a new check box will appear in the UI to set 'Land Cover Masking.' This can also be done via Lua (see below.)</p> <p></p> <p>Aircraft flying 'land cover masking' will fly much lower than the existing terrain following mode, as low as 10 ft AGL at loiter speed in open terrain with good visibility.</p> <p>If the scenario has the 'Terrain Effects' feature enabled, an aircraft flying 'land cover masking' will fly just low enough to be inside the land cover when possible. For example if land cover at the aircraft's location is 'urban/built up' with a height of 9m then the aircraft will fly at 8m. This allows the aircraft to receive concealment from the land cover (see sensor changes below) while still exposing any mast-mounted sensors it may have (a good example is OH-58D with its mast-mounted optics).</p> <p>Land Cover and Sensor Detection Ranges</p> <p>The effect of land cover on the maximum sensor detection ranges for visual, IR, and radar sensors has been changed. (NOTE: as before, land cover only effects sensor detection range when the 'Terrain Effects' feature is enabled in the scenario settings.)</p> <p>Previously, only the land cover at the target's location influenced sensor detection range. Now the sensor itself is checked to see if it is 'within land cover' (i.e. it clears the skyline or not) and this applies an additional reduction in detection range if the height of the sensor is below the local skyline. In addition, the land cover along the 'line of sight' between the sensor and the target will also reduce sensor detection range whenever the LOS point is below the local skyline.</p> <p>These changes can result is significantly shorter detection ranges for ground-to-ground sensor detections when there is 'high' land cover in the area (e.g. woods and/or urban terrain.). Very low-flying aircraft (using the 'land cover masking' mode) can also have reduced detection ranges if they are flying below the local skyline (and dodging telephone poles or power lines, probably).</p> <p>Lua Changes</p> <p>New Lua support has been added for the features above:</p> <p>Land Cover Masking Flight Mode</p> <p>'Land cover masking' mode can also be set via Lua using the Unit wrapper. Set the 'unit.TF' property to 'true' to turn on terrain following and then set the new 'unit.TFType' property to 1 (for land cover masking) or '0' (for traditional terrain following AGL flight.)</p> <p>Custom Environment Zones</p> <p>Lua support for custom environment zones has been expanded.</p> <p>The ScenEdit_AddZone, ScenEditRemoveZone, and ScenEdit_TransformZone functions now support CEZs. CEZs are always added to/removed from the 'nature' side. CEZ values are set via the CEZ wrapper object (see below.)</p> <p>Lua Side wrapper has a new property and a new method:</p> <p>Side.Customenvironmentzones read-only property -- returns a table of CEZ guid/name/description. Note: only the 'Nature' side will have CEZs normally.</p> <p>Side:getcustomenvironmentzone(guid or name or description) method -- returns the CEZ as a zone wrapper object.</p> <p>Lua Zone object wrapper:</p> <p>Zone.landcovertype property -- get/set integer land cover type.</p> <p>Zone.hascustomlandcoverheight read-only property -- returns true if CEZ has custom land cover height set.</p> <p>Zone.landcoverheight property -- get/set integer land cover height in meters.</p> <p>Zone.thermallayerceiling property -- get/set thermal layer ceiling in meters.</p> <p>Zone.thermallayerfloor property -- get/set thermal layer floor in meters.</p> <p>Zone.thermallayerstrength property -- get/set thermal layer strength as floating-point value.</p> <p>Zone.convergencezoneinterval property -- get/set convergence zone interval as floating-point value.</p> <p>Zone.weatherprofile property -- get/set weather profile as a Lua table with 'temp', 'rainfall', 'undercloud', and 'seastate' table fields with the same values as the weather model.</p> <p>Other things</p> <p>* ADDED: Added support for \"multi-staged missile\" flag. Multi-staged AAW missiles (e.g. SA-5) have a lower burnout weight in proportion to their overall launch weight. This helps them achieve better climb performance post-burnout, but if they loft it also means that they are less able to use their mass to re-energize on their post-loft dive.</p> <p>* ADDED: Indication of which AC is the leader in an airgroup</p> <p>* TWEAK: Mission's WRA now supports queued dynamic units.</p> <p>* TWEAK: Battery-powered torpedoes accelerate much faster than thermal ones</p> <p>* ADDED: Added support (incl. damage mechanics) for new \"blimp\" airship type</p> <p>* FIXED: ACs with standoff weapons where flying toward the target after the WPnLaunch</p> <p>* FIXED: Importing a unit with extra parking facilities reports overfilled for every extra aircraft</p> <p>* FIXED: Special Message Window Sizing</p> <p>* FIXED: #14909: Add \"Ground Units\" to Event Triggers</p> <p>* FIXED: [Mission Editor] Deleting all missions in ME was impossible due to retained reference to the last mission selected; this then caused the last deleted mission to \"resurrect\" upon any interaction (such as assigning a new unit)</p> <p>* FIXED: CTD when Clicking on ATO or flight plan editor button in ME with no mission selected</p> <p>* FIXED: Exception in Balloon popup was causing a multitude of messages to appear on screen</p> <p>* FIXED: [B1307.4] Strike Mission 'Enforced' Flight Size seems to max out at 6</p> <p>* FIXED: Early Experience with the New Strike Planner (points 1 &amp; 2)</p> <p>* FIXED: #14892: Imported facilities don't maintain heading</p> <p>* FIXED: Lua SetTrigger not allowing target filter of side only</p> <p>* FIXED: Lua unit course - allow any desired speed up to unit maximum</p> <p>* FIXED: #14904: Not all manually allocated missiles firing</p> <p>* Includes the new v499 release of the DB3000 and CWDB databases.</p> <p>DB3000 changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmuwnZ ... sp=sharing</p> <p>CWDB changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y-vuNJ ... sp=sharing</p> <p>* Includes a tweaked &amp; corrected version of the \"Showcase #2: Ford Class\" DLC scenario.

This tab allows the user to create a Targeting Priority List to control how a unit prioritizes engaging known targets. Targeting Priority is a component of a Doctrine, and thus follows all the existing conventions for Doctrines in\u00a0Command\u00a0-- they can be assigned at the unit, group, mission, or side level and will inherit from higher-level Doctrines:</p> <p></p> <p>The Targeting Priority List UI will display the Targeting Priority that applies to the Doctrine you're currently viewing. You can only edit the Targeting Priority List if it is a part of the current Doctrine -- i.e. not inherited from a higher-level Doctrine.</p> <p>Every Targeting Priority List will contain a single 'default' priority entry. Entries above the 'default' entry in the list will be considered 'immediate' priority targets, to be engaged before any other targets. Entries below the default entry in the list are considered 'delayed' priority, to be engaged only if no higher priority targets are available. The 'default' priority entry will automatically match any target(s) that do not match any other entry in the Targeting Priority List, allowing the player to prioritize (or de-prioritize) individual target types while leaving all other target types to fall into the 'default' category.</p> <p>Create:\u00a0Allows you to create a Priority Target List for the current Doctrine. This will override any inherited Targeting Priority.</p> <p>Remove:\u00a0Removes the Targeting Priority List from the current Doctrine. The Doctrine will automatically inherit from higher level Targeting Priorities, if they exist.</p> <p>Move Up:\u00a0Move the selected item up one row in the list.</p> <p>Move Down:\u00a0Move the selected item down one row in the list.</p> <p>Add Item:\u00a0Add a new item above the currently selected item in the list.</p> <p>Delete Item:\u00a0Deletes the currently selected item from the list. NOTE: You cannot delete the default priority item.</p> <p>Doctrine Targeting Priority applies as one of the final criteria when a unit is selecting a target. Other Doctrine settings (Rules Of Engagement, Weapon Release Authorization, etc.) and general AI targeting considerations (side posture, mission applicability, weapon effectiveness, etc.) are applied\u00a0before\u00a0the Doctrine Targeting Priority is checked. So for example, if a unit does not have a weapon to engage a given target, or that target is not considered relevant to the unit's current mission, the target will not be considered as a potential target regardless of Targeting Priority. Each entry in the Targeting Priority List is evaluated in turn against a unit's final potential targets. If an 'immediate' priority entry is matched, the unit will engage the target(s) that match that entry, ignoring lower priority targets. If a 'delayed' priority entry is matched the unit will engage the target(s) that match that entry only if there are no higher priority targets. If there are multiple potential targets remaining after the Targeting Priority is applied the\u00a0Command\u00a0AI will select one of those targets based on its general AI and/or mission target selection behavior -- typically closest-first, while attempting to spread attackers across multiple targets.</p> <p>NOTE:\u00a0In some cases the unit AI will evaluate a nearby hostile unit as an immediate threat and engage it in preference to all other targets. The Priority Targeting List is ignored in this case. Targeting Priority Doctrine can be changed via Lua using the Doctrine wrapper object. The Doctrine wrapper can be obtained from a unit, group, mission, or side wrapper object via its doctrine property. See 'Lua Changes' below for further details.</p> <p>Lua additions for Targeting priority feature:</p> <p>ActiveUnit wrapper:\u00a0ActiveUnit.doctrine\u00a0read-only property -- returns the Doctrine wrapper object for the unit's Doctrine.</p> <p>Group wrapper:\u00a0Group.doctrine\u00a0read-only property -- returns the Doctrine wrapper object for the group's Doctrine.</p> <p>Mission wrapper:\u00a0Mission.doctrine\u00a0read-only property -- returns the Doctrine wrapper object for the mission's Doctrine.</p> <p>Doctrine object wrapper:</p> <p>*\u00a0Doctrine.TargetPriority\u00a0read-only property -- returns a Lua table with the contents of the doctrine's priority target list, if any. Fields for each item in the table are: -- unit_type (integer) = ActiveUnitType -- unit_subtype (integer) = AircraftType, ShipType, SubmarineType, FacilityCategory, WeaponType, MobileGroundUnitCategory, depending on unit_type. -- Isfixedfacilitysubtype (Boolean) = For fixed facility unit_type, 'true' indicates the unit_subtype is a value from FacilityCategory, 'false' indicates the unit_subtype is from MobileGroundUnitCategory. -- dbid (integer) = the specific DBID. -- priority (integer) = 0 (delayed), 1 (default), 2 (immediate) engagement priority.</p> <p>*\u00a0Doctrine:deleteTargetPriorityEntry(index)\u00a0method -- deletes the corresponding item from the priority target list, if it exists. NOTE: index value is 0-based. Returns the list as a Lua table.</p> <p>*\u00a0Doctrine:addTargetPriorityEntry(type, subtype, isfixedfacilitysubtype, dbid, index)\u00a0method -- all arguments are integers save for 'isfixedfacilitysubtype' which is a Boolean value. 'type', 'subtype', 'isfixedfacilitytype', and 'dbid' are as explained for the TargetPriority property above.

ASAT &amp;</p> <p>ABM) capability were separated in their target detection capacity by altitude and target</p> <p>type; ie. air-search radars could detect aerodynamic targets within the atmosphere,</p> <p>whereas space-search radars could detect BMs and RVs outside the atmosphere. While</p> <p>broadly accurate, this abstraction left a lot of unrealistic cases: For example a fighter</p> <p>radar could detect an RV in its terminal phase, or endoatmospheric guided weapons</p> <p>such as hypersonic missiles where not detected by BMD radars.</p> <p>o IRL, radars use velocity filters (in addition to altitude ceilings) to specialize in their search</p> <p>task and minimize false contacts etc. Command now correctly replicates this behavior,</p> <p>with some assumptions for the minimum and maximum velocity values:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Air-only search radars may detect any target from 0 knots (hover) up to Mach 5</p> </li> <li> <p>Space-only search radars (ie. BMD/ASAT) can detect any target from Mach 2 up</p> </li> </ul> <p>to \"unlimited\" velocity</p> <ul> <li>Combined air &amp; space-search capable radars use the full velocity spectrum</li> </ul> <p>o This addition allows more realistic representation of the capabilities and limitations of</p> <p>each type of radar, against the full gamut of endo- and exo-atmospheric targets.</p> <p>\u2022 ADDED: Feedback for \"Unit Add\" when an airbase cannot host a unit</p> <p>\u2022 ADDED: Autodetectable feedbacks: Added a warning when adding an autodetectable target to</p> <p>Mission target list and added a specific bark message when an engagement is failing because the</p> <p>target is autodetectable but is not emitting (e.g. SEAD strike on fixed but silent radar)</p> <p>\u2022 ADDED: [Lua] New method for creating a new blank scenario: Tool_BuildBlankScenario()</p> <p>\u2022 Includes revised tutorial scenarios by Brandon Johnson.</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: ABM-optimized radars can scan all the way up to vertical zenith (instead of 80 degrees)</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: Numerous tweaks, fixes &amp; improvements on BMD engagement logics. Not covering all</p> <p>known issues but should resolve most egregious cases (famous last words).</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: Error message for unhostable unit behind a check for \"Side is Human controlled\"</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: Using a modified random-number-generator (RNG) to ward off edge cases like</p> <p>constantly returning 0 if hammered from multiple threads</p> <p>\u2022 Tweak: DB-viewer: if re-using window, act on highlighted item if passed</p> <p>\u2022 Tweak: DB-viewer: Re-enable \"scroll to\" for sidebar links</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: [QOL] If you open the side- or mission-level WRA with a contact selected, the contact's</p> <p>relevant WRA category is highlighted (yellow)</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: Platforms with a sonar (if selected) will now always render the direct-path range, even if</p> <p>CZs are not possible in their location</p> <p>\u2022 TWEAK: When a contact that is a potential SEAD target (e.g. an enemy radar facility) is detected</p> <p>radiating, its WRA target-type is presented as \"[Normal WRA type, e.g. building or mobile vehicle]</p> <p>+ Radar\". This indicates to the user this contact's \"dual\" WRA nature.

Head into the properties section and opt into the beta branch, it will become available to download.</p> <p>This update is the culmination of a months-long endeavour to consolidate our development branches on a stable, solid release and address the various significant issues reported earlier this year on the B1328.xx series. We have received very positive feedback on the result during internal testing, and we hope this also applies to our wider public userbase.</p> <p>Because this is a release focused on quality improvement and issue fixes, there are only a few new additions. The most significant are:</p> <p>* A revised HTML-rendering backend, using Microsoft's new WebView2 rendering engine. You should notice improved HTML rendering on the DB-viewer and other UI elements that use HTML sources. This also aloows richer custom UI elements at the beginning of a scenario (e.g. to define custom options for the scenario, difficulty settings etc.)</p> <p>* Indicators for aircraft contrails and ship/submarine wakes can be displayed on the map, under a unit's datablock. This makes it easier for the player to be more aware that his units may be visually detected at significantly longer ranges because of these factors. These indicators can be disabled on the \"Game Options\" window (similar to noise &amp; cavitation indicators) if they clutter the map unacceptably.</p> <p>* The new update also includes the long-awaited new releases of the DB3000 &amp; Cold-War DB databases (yes, the AIM-174B is included in v507).</p> <p>DB3000 v506 changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0UWMU ... sp=sharing</p> <p>CWDB v506 changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n8oSgf ... sp=sharing</p> <p>DB3000 v507 changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1myeLWr ... sp=sharing</p> <p>CWDB v507 changelog: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nBHZT2 ... sp=sharing</p> <p>v1.07.XXXX</p> <p>Command v1.07 (Build 1487) Release Notes (changes from v1.06 - Build 1328.xx)</p> <p>=======================================================</p> <p>NEW FEATURE: Show aerospace units in their true altitude (a.k.a. \"pin-cushion view\"). Disabled by default (for now), it can be enabled in \"Game Options --&gt; Map Display --&gt; Draw units at true altitude\". When enabled, air &amp; space units are shown in their true altitudes rather than as \"ground-tracks\" on the planet surface. To help visualize their vertical placement, a gray vertical pole is drawn from the unit to the surface (similar to Tacview's \"Display Object Height\" setting). If a unit is out of the visible viewpoint but its ground-track is still visible, the unit's icon is ghost-drawn at the ground-track position, to indicate the unit's horizontal location.</p> <p>ADDED: Revised HTML-rendering backend, using Microsoft's new WebView2 rendering engine. You should notice improved HTML rendering on the DB-viewer and other UI elements that use HTML sources. This also allows richer custom UI elements at the beginning of a scenario (e.g. to define custom options for the scenario, difficulty settings etc.)</p> <p>ADDED: Aircraft fuel on-load rate restriction (requires v508+ DBs). When activated, the bottleneck on A2A fuel transfer is not just the offload capacity of the tanker, but also the onload capacity of the aircraft. Also the calculation for transfer rate is now the same for CMO &amp; CPE.</p> <p>ADDED: Indicators for aircraft contrails and ship/submarine wakes can be displayed on the map, under a unit's datablock. This makes it easier for the player to be more aware that his units may be visually detected at significantly longer ranges because of these factors. These indicators can be disabled on the \"Map Settings\" menu if they clutter the map unacceptably.</p> <p>(Clarification: Contrails and wakes have been part of the simulation engine since CMANO's original 2013 release. This change adds visual indicators for them)</p> <p>ADDED: [Lua] New method \"ScenEdit_WeaponAllocation\" to show weapon allocation from attacker to target. Syntax: ScenEdit_WeaponAllocation(attackerGUID, contactGUID, attackingSideGUID)</p> <p>supply attacker and contact GUIDs to see salvos generated between the 2</p> <p>supply attacker GUID and empty contact to see salvos from the attacker to anyone</p> <p>supply contact GUID and empty attacker to see salvos against contact. Note in this case, you MUST supply the side from which attacks are coming from.</p> <p>ADDED: [QOL] Possibility to copy and paste zones through the zone context menu (Shift+RMB)</p> <p>ADDED: Notification bark to let the player know if the AC reached the weapon release point too early (explanation for the occasional \"hover on waypoint\" behavior)</p> <p>ADDED: [Lua] Added TimeZulu to the flight plan WP wrapper</p> <p>ADDED: Formation Editor accessible in unit mode when group member is selected</p> <p>ADDED: [Lua] Function for resetting the message log: Tool_ResetMessageLog([Optional: Print First]). If the optional \"print first\" value is set to True, the message log will first be written out to \\Logs\\AALog.txt before being purged.</p> <p>Includes updates &amp; fixes to these official scenarios:</p> <p>Standalone - Chasing Aphrodite, 2019</p> <p>Standalone - Iron Hand, 2014</p> <p>Standalone - Maria and Victoria</p> <p>Kashmir Fire - 2. Retaliation</p> <p>Kashmir Fire - 4. Doomsday Clock</p> <p>Kashmir Fire - 8. Flaming Dragon</p> <p>Kashmir Fire - 12. Thunder From The Sea</p> <p>Showcase Ford Class</p> <p>The Silent Service - 2. Ground Pounder</p> <p>The Silent Service - 3. Chicken Kiev</p> <p>Includes the v506, v507 and v508 releases of the DB3000 &amp; Cold-War DB databases. This concludes the months-long China national overhaul, one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the DB team (details: https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/issues/4131). The Command database is now arguably one of the most comprehensive open-source compilations of information on modern Chinese military equipment (excl. small arms).</p> <p>DB3000 v506 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0UWMUiqniOgaqt7NrbvaRvBPjg4b82P/view</p> <p>CWDB v506 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n8oSgftzyF3Jw9lUxuyMCh-c_wBnICH2/view</p> <p>DB3000 v507 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1myeLWrzWbGBE5Ddwhrz7uX4yIPn5j78c/view</p> <p>CWDB v507 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nBHZT2mQiUg74AvyZPXiPTbFnro5SKfr/view</p> <p>DB3000 v508 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wD5-lO4K_jUS4yuQ6BLpQqd_vRcV6490/view</p> <p>CWDB v508 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w4IIuX_glHk9SGpnPT6jW7JR47SybvOp/view</p> <p>TWEAK: The Sentinel-2 map layer is now disabled by default</p> <p>TWEAK: Better formatting for camera altitude text</p> <p>TWEAK: Speed boost in DLZ calcs if the target is higher than the weapon's ceiling</p> <p>TWEAK: Weapon Endgame reports with more specific wording</p> <p>TWEAK on lofted AAW weapon trajectory: If climbing post-burnout and getting close to stalling, begin terminal dive towards the target</p> <p>TWEAK: Improvement on secondary targets management for bombing + WRA check</p> <p>TWEAK: On \"Head To First Waypoint\", start the climb/dive to the next waypoint's desired altitude only when we are within the horizontal distance needed for the climb/dive (this prevents aircraft from starting their climb/dive too early)</p> <p>TWEAK: The flight planner will now always set the weapon release altitude according to the mission profile's \"attack altitude ingress\" value - allowing for minimum safe height</p> <p>TWEAK: Force sim to pause on File-&gt; StartMenu</p> <p>TWEAK: Removed the obsolete \"Test Scripts\" top-level menu</p> <p>TWEAK: scenario duration color on Begin Scenario Button set to white</p> <p>TWEAK: Spread the OpenTopoMap tile calls to the three different known servers, to increase download throughput (and bypass throttling blocks)</p> <p>TWEAK: The slug-trails are now rendered as an actual fading trail instead of unselected ref-points</p> <p>TWEAK: Rotated icons and vectors at the edge of the globe will no longer show heading as if they were looked at directly from the top, but will instead be rendered as pointing to the heading they are actually moving towards</p> <p>TWEAK: On Docking Ops window, list the hosted units of each platform in natural-sort order</p> <p>TWEAK: Do not draw the mouse cursor databox if the mouse cursor is pointing outside the planet</p> <p>Numerous significant sim-speed improvements.</p> <p>A large number of miscellaneous issue from B1328.xx have been resolved.</p> <p>FIXED: Outline not being rendered and overlapping text for caption bar</p> <p>FIXED: Contact vertical speed was not recomputed each pulse</p> <p>FIXED: Exception when Primary Target isn't a unit (aimpoint, etc.)</p> <p>FIXED: #16156 Cold War DB possible matches for emission detection incorrect (if previously played a DB3000 scenario)</p> <p>FIXED: [Build 1405 CIV] Nooo!

For details see here: https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=5886</p> <p>* NEW FEATURE: Communications jamming (previously only in CPE, excluding scripting) is now also available in CMO. (See original article on comms disruption &amp; effects: https://command.matrixgames.com/?p=4454))</p> <p>* NEW OPTIONAL SCENARIO REALISM FEATURE: ASCM terrain-following restrictions. When this (off by default) feature is active, early ASCMs who lack TF capability cannot overfly land with elevation higher than their cruise altitude (unit is actively blocked from firing, both in auto-fire and also through the manual weapon allocation window). If the weapon is fired nevertheless (e.g. BOL shot) and encounters terrain higher than its cruise altitude, it smashes into it. ( \\&lt; This means that is possible, but risky, to fire such missiles over very low-elevation land terrain such as atolls etc.)</p> <p>Non-TF ASCMs with waypoint capability (e.g. Harpoon Block 1C) can be fired with a plotted course around landmasses, to avoid the \"land between shooter and target\" restriction when this feature is active. On the manual weapon allocation window, if the selected salvo has a suitable complex course that avoids landmass, non-TF ASCMs show up as \"green\" (can fire).</p> <p>* NEW SIM FEATURE: \"Depressed trajectory\" capability for certain ballistic missiles (Requires v512+ DBs). Missiles who have this capability will use the \"low\" trajectory option in any less-than-maximum range shot (the default behavior for most BMs is to use the \"high\" trajectory leg).</p> <p>(Currently only the Russian Iskander-M/E and its North Korean analog KN-23 are flagged as such in the database. If you have sources for other systems having the same capability, feel free to share them on the DB tracker: https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/))</p> <p>* MAJOR REVISION: Revised user interface and new capabilities for Doctrine/ROE window.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Instead of concentrating doctrine options on a single crammed window, they are now separated into per-category tabs. This makes it both faster to find a specific option and also affords more space for adding more options in the future: https://imgur.com/a/VKM1F8s</p> </li> <li> <p>Doctrine settings may be automatically filtered/excluded if they are not applicable to the selected unit(s). In this example, a single ship is selected, and only the doctrine settings that are relevant to surface ships are displayed: https://imgur.com/a/lCv9k9j</p> </li> <li> <p>The \"mini display\" of doctrine options in the right UI column has been removed, and replaced by a semi-automatic system of \"doctrine deconfliction\". The game attempts to detect common doctrine &amp; mission conflicts (e.g. having WCS \"hold\" on a weapon while being a patrol with that weapon) and suggest to the player fixes for them; the player can then approve the fix change or ignore the suggestion. Example: https://imgur.com/a/c7DTRAB</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved simulation stability &amp; performance on doctrine-related paths</p> </li> <li> <p>More responsive doctrine UI sections</p> </li> </ul> <p>Includes the new v512 databases.</p> <ul> <li> <p>DB3000 v512 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PvOV1NivFzh_vrXKW-i_LIW0dlMIcQDC/view?usp=sharing</p> </li> <li> <p>CWDB v512 additions: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mB2Ko3DnI4Lfql-PZGdEFqjd105NAmaW/view?usp=sharing</p> </li> </ul> <p>* Includes the thoroughly reworked &amp; revised edition of \"The Silent Service\" DLC. All known scenario issues have been fixed, and a host of various tweaks and improvements made on each scenario.</p> <p>* Includes updated versions of Fail-Safe #1, #2 and #5.</p> <p>* Includes updated DB description files by Steve Lohr and KGambit</p> <p>* ADDED: Chainsaw/Grinder Movement Style for Patrol Missions (see: https://x.com/RSE_VB/status/1897710024937365913))</p> <p>* ADDED: Ability to select what datablock information is shown for units &amp; contacts (just track number &amp; name, or also kinematics, or everything)</p> <p>* Added: UI elements that give information on time passed and identifying unit for last reported position of out of comms units</p> <p>* ADDED: Banner with information about CPE shown at startup (can be disabled by checking the checkbox \"Do not show on startup\")</p> <p>* ADDED: New message type: Comms-related message. This handlesd all messages related to comms (suffering comms jamming or other disruption, re-jioning the comms grid etc.). Messages about events happening while the unit is off-grid (sensor detections etc.) are still covered by the \"Comms Isolated Message\" type.</p> <p>* ADDED: Added support for additional windows to Tool_UIWindow() Lua function: 'airops', 'boatops', 'readyarm', 'mounts', 'sensors', 'emcon', and 'magazines'</p> <p>* ADDED: [Lua] New unit wrapper property to show aircraft flight range: :flightRange(throttle, speed, altitude). Setting parameters to nil implies using the current values.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>local u = ScenEdit_GetUnit({name='Looking #1', guid='207d76e0-e5be-4012-bbc8-93a142bb5b7b'})</p> <p>print(u:flightRange(nil,nil,nil))</p> <p>Result = { endurance = 21863, range = 1214.61108398438 }</p> <p>* ADDED: [Lua] \"tracknumber\" read-only property on contact wrapper-object</p> <p>* ADDED: [Lua] Added ability to migrate scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Example for single use: print(Tool_Scen_Migration({scenario='D:/CMO/Scenarios/mine lua test.scen', config='D:/CMO/Scenarios/mine lua test.ini',dbfile='DB3K_510.db3'}))</p> </li> <li> <p>Example for batch file: print(Tool_Scen_Migration({scenario='D:/CMO/Scenarios/batchfile.xml', config='batch',dbfile='DB3K_510.db3'}))</p> </li> </ul> <p>* ADDED: [Lua] Add loadout enums to Lua table</p> <p>* ADDED: [Lua] New property .ToString for \"Event\" wrapper object (shows basic event info in a print statement)</p> <p>* TWEAK: The Sentinel-2 map layer now uses per-zoom-Level tile packing, which allows increased performance and also faster download and installation</p> <p>* TWEAK: The unit-status thumbnail and the DB-viewer now use webp (instead of jpg) as the image format. (You may temporarily have a shortage of shown images as these are repopulated from the server on-demand)</p> <p>* TWEAK: Re-enabled sluggish rudders</p> <p>* TWEAK: Various sim-speed tweaks</p> <p>* TWEAK: Various speed tweaks on map tile rendering</p> <p>* Tweak: no trails are created for ActiveUnits that are not operating</p> <p>* TWEAK: Removed \"WRA cannot be fulfilled\" messages since it might be causing confusion</p> <p>* Tweak: no trails are created for Groups to avoid artifacts</p> <p>* Tweak: [Lua] ScenEdit_RunScript returns True if execution is succesful, False if execution fails, nil if execution does not even start or an exception is encountered</p> <p>* Tweak: Unit that goes out-of-comms now self reports an identified contact for itself, aiding other allied units in tracking its position</p> <p>* TWEAK: Tweaks on the Lua Console for better visibility of methods selection</p> <p>* TWEAK: Various tweaks &amp; improvements on barks mechanism</p> <p>* Tweak: Passing through a support mission RP while refueling counts as having passed through</p> <p>* TWEAK: On contact datablocks, show the track number distinctly from the rest of the contact name</p> <p>* TWEAK: \"Show Diagnostics\" is now \"True\" by default</p> <p>* TWEAK: Faster and more efficient sorting of messages on message log window</p> <p>* TWEAK: Tweaked datablock rendering of contact track number according to NATO APP-6D symbology (\"TN:XXX\")</p> <p>* TWEAK: Significant threading &amp; performance improvement on simulation engine</p> <p>* TWEAK: [Lua] VP_GetContact now also supports track-number as the search key</p> <p>* TWEAK: [Lua] ScenEdit_GetContact can now also use a contact's track number as the search key</p> <p>* TWEAK: [Lua] The summary list provided by ScenEdit_GetContacts now also includes each contact's track-number</p> <p>* TWEAK: No-comm drones shouldn't engage targets when \"drone autonomy levels\" scen feature is not active</p> <p>* TWEAK: Enforced a more rigid waypoint altitude check in MDSP</p> <p>* TWEAK: #16623: Reduced the sidebar scrollbar size</p> <p>* TWEAK: #16636: Strike mission now defaults to focusing on target instead of engaging opportunity targets</p> <p>* TWEAK: When running in interactive-GUI mode, the simulation thread gets set to \"Lowest\" priority (This reduces raw sim-engine performance, but has two UX benefits: (a) It reduces the impact of sim execution on UI responsiveness (map zoom/pan lag, general UI lag etc.) (b) It reduces the impact of sim execution on the overall OS responsiveness)</p> <p>* TWEAK: Force the application at startup to run as DPI-unaware, and log this on the exception log as part of the startup info. (This is independent of the DPI setting stored on the registry, so if this works reliably players should no longer need to manually use the 4KFIx tool)</p> <p>* TWEAK: Air intercept missions have \"Engage Opportunity Targets\" ON and \"Focus Entirely On Strike Targets\" OFF by default</p> <p>* TWEAK: Updated collapse section code in DB viewer</p> <p>* TWEAK: Map refresh is now both smoother

consistency</p> <p>* TWEAK: \"Filter by Keyword\" check boxes eliminated on Add[component] type panels</p> <p>* TWEAK: Improved framerate / UI response for large scenarios</p> <p>* TWEAK: QoL addition for showing next waypoint in \"Unit Status\" when on plotted course</p> <p>* TWEAK: Flights with a mission profile that requires too much fuel are generated and a visual warning allows the user to tweak the flight plan (no changes when the side is not human controlled)</p> <p>* TWEAK: Cruise missiles have no boresight launch limits</p> <p>* TWEAK: Various sim-speed tweaks</p> <p>* MAJOR FIX: \"Message Log\" window still showing log items that are no longer in the simulation's in-memory log ( \\&lt;\\&lt; This solves cases of past problem reports like \"UI &amp; sim getting incrementally more sluggish as number of log messages increases\")</p> <p>* FIXED: Deserialization of last reported information for out-of-comms units</p> <p>* FIXED: #16469: (1567.5) Flight lead doesn't RTB when

The top screenshot has the Sentinel-2 layer enabled, while the lower one has the BMNG Layer disabled entirely.</p> <p>As in the real world, COMMAND's environment is affected by the terrain and weather and has a profound effect on your sensors, weapons, and tactics. It thus pays a lot to be aware of your natural surroundings. To get a better understanding of the world in your operations theater, feel free to mouse over the globe and notice the cursor data block's display of land elevations and terrain types while over land and bathymetric data (including convergence zone [CZ] information) while over water.</p> <p>This is important because terrain affects operations greatly. Underwater, the data block displays the depth of the water and other features vital for submarine warfare. One is the depth and strength of the thermal layer, a feature that serves as a natural barrier to sound transmission. Another is the distance of convergence zones, which allow vessels with long-range passive sonar to pick up contacts well beyond the short range of direct paths.</p> <p>Over land, the slope and type of land determines how fast land units can move, what exact paths they take (units will steer around mountains rather than trying to climb them), how visible they are, and how shielded they are from explosive attacks against them. Greater slope, even without any terrain effects, makes land units slower. Water terrain features (lakes) are totally impassable by land units.</p> <p>Wetlands and snow both slow down land units considerably (the former to a greater extent) and make them less visible. Forests, and to a lesser extent shrublands, both significantly slow down and shield the land units from eyes and bombs alike. Croplands and vegetation mosaics have a small visibility and speed reduction, while savannas have a minor speed reduction. Barren and grassland terrain acts as a \"base case\" with no modifiers, while urban terrain offers the greatest shielding and, contrary to the others, makes land units slightly faster due to the availability of paved roads. Several terrain types are also highly disruptive to radar detection. These types are forests (all sub-types), croplands and urban. Obtaining a radar detection in these areas is significantly more difficult.</p> <p>Moving the cursor around the theater can be very important. The presence or absence of convergence zones is a game changer in anti-submarine warfare. As sloping and terrain significantly determine the pathing of land units (and the presence of islands and shores the pathing of naval ones), seeing what's where is important in knowing where to send one's bomber aircraft to hit those land units.</p>"},{"location":"user-interface/#312-terrain-and-land-cover","title":"3.1.2 Terrain and Land Cover","text":"<p>COMMAND simulates many different effects of terrain ranging from unit detectability to the effects of munitions on in dense and barren areas. In addition to the type of terrain, terrain has three height values:</p> <p></p> <p>Elevation refers to the ground level of the terrain with no objects present such as trees or buildings. The height refers to the average height of objects on that terrain, such as trees or buildings, and the skyline is the average height of the objects plus the base level of the terrain underneath it. These values are useful to a planner because they give you the ability to plan terrain masking attacks, and some types of units such as AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopter can 'rest' behind the skyline of the terrain and stick various sensors outside of the terrain making it possible to detect units without being easily engaged.</p> <p>The slope of terrain as well as the type of terrain has an impact on the performance of ground units. Some units such as hovercraft can easily move between different types of terrain, but struggle with slope and certain terrain densities.

If enabled, it will fire them. If disabled, it will not.</p> <p>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT:</p> <p>Weapons Control Status: Determines rules of engagement for either air, surface, subsurface, or land targets. Weapons TIGHT means the unit(s) will fire at confirmed hostile targets only. Weapons FREE means it will fire at anything that isn't confirmed friendly (possibly dangerous to neutrals or allies). Weapons HOLD means it will not fire on its own at all and will launch only if manually ordered.</p> <p>Ignore Plotted Course: If enabled, the unit will abandon its previously (manually) plotted course while attacking a target. If disabled, it will not.</p> <p>Engage Ambiguous: Sets the AI behavior when considering using a weapon. Each weapon has certain tolerances calculated on-the-fly for down/cross-range; most direct-guidance systems want a precise target, most LOAL weapons have relatively strict cross-range tolerance (equal to the sensor swath) but relaxed downrange tolerance because of their BOL ability, area-effect weapons can tolerate up to their kill zone etc. If the target's ambiguity figures are greater than the weapon tolerances, this is explained in the manual weapon allocation window and the weapon will not be fired. This dialog has three options besides \"inherited\".</p> <p>An ambiguous contact is any contact with an uncertainty area. When set to \"ignore ambiguity\", the AI will ignore the ambiguity when determining whether or not to launch a weapon. Select this at one's risk, for the chance of hitting a phantom or moved contact is incredibly high. When set to \"Optimistic\", the target uncertainty area must be smaller than 3x the weapon tolerance for the AI to launch the weapon. When set to \"Pessimistic\", the target location uncertainty must be less than the weapon tolerance for the AI to launch the weapon.</p> <p>Engage Opportunity: If enabled, the unit will engage targets not directly related to the mission at hand. If disabled, it will not. Enable at one's own risk, for this can lead to dangerous behavior.</p> <p>Emission Control (EMCON)</p> <p>Ignore EMCON when under attack: If enabled, the unit will turn on its emitting sensors when it's actively engaged defensively (the theory being that since it's already been found, there's no use hiding and weakening its defenses anymore). If disabled, it will continue with its previous EMCON state even if attacked.</p> <p>MISC:</p> <p>Kinematic Range: If enabled, the unit will fire torpedoes to its kinematic (maximum physical) range. The much shorter \"practical range\" is there to ensure that the target cannot avoid the torpedo simply by running at flank speed in the opposite direction. Kinematic range can be set for always practical, always kinematic, or kinematic for manual shots. The kinematic for manual setting means a submarine set on a patrol mission running into warships will engage at a practical range, but if the player sees a slow merchant ship with no sonar, they can engage it from a distance with a manual allocation.</p> <p>Automatic Evasion: The game has several pre-programmed evasions routines that the AI will undertake if it detects it is under attack. This RoE gives you the ability to turn this behavior of and off. In some cases, turning it to NO is useful if having aircraft pressing their attacks is desired.</p> <p>Refuel:</p> <p>Refuel/UNREP: This changes whether or not aircraft will refuel, and ships will resupply each other. It can be turned on, turned off, or (default) turned on but not have tankers attempt to refuel each other.</p> <p>Refuel/UNREP Selection: This allows tankers to be chosen, be they simply the nearest ones, tankers closer to the objective, or an even greater priority to closer-target tankers.</p> <p>Refuel/UNREP Allied Units: This allows supply units to refuel ones from sides other than the player. Available choices are allowing it, allowing either onloading or offloading only, or forbidding it altogether.</p> <p>Refuel to Tanker Threshold: Sets the threshold for when an aircraft will seek out a tanker if set to refuel.</p> <p>Air Operations:</p> <p>Air Operations Tempo: This changes the overall tempo of the side's air operations. A \"surge\" tempo generates sorties at a far quicker rate than a \"sustained\" tempo. Historically, \"surge\" tempos cannot be maintained for very long. Sustained is thus recommended for a scenario set in the middle of a long air campaign, at the end of a long logistical chain, or both. (There were two \"Surge\" periods in the Gulf War air campaign, at the beginning and during the ground war.)</p> <p>Note that tempo is different from the ready times included in the aircraft loadouts.</p> <p>Quick Turnaround: This enables quick turnaround for suitable aircraft and loadouts.</p> <p>Quick turnaround is used to model frenzied air activity such as the Israeli strikes at the beginning of the Six Day War. It enables aircraft to repeatedly fly brief missions with a short ready time before the inevitable cooldown.</p> <ul> <li> <p>YES-all possible quick turn platforms are enabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>FIGHTERS AND ASW-This enables non air-to-ground loadouts for quick   turnaround. Air to ground ones are disabled and ready at the same   overall tempo.</p> </li> <li> <p>NO-No quick turnaround allowed. Loadouts ready at the default   operational tempo.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Fuel State/Pre-Planned: This changes the time when an aircraft automatically considers itself having insufficient fuel and returns to base. The default is \"Bingo\" (just enough to make it back), but can be changed to various \"Joker\" states to provide an additional barrier against running out of fuel.</p> <p>Fuel State/RTB: This changes when the individual aircraft in a flight return to base. It can be set to individual units leaving, when the first aircraft reaches bingo/joker (encouraged), when the last aircraft does so (EXTREMELY risky), or not RTBing at all at the fuel state (Even riskier yet, only done in the event of some assured micromanagement).</p> <p>NOTE: The default fuel RTB settings are there for a reason. Change at your own risk and be aware that losing the aircraft to a lack of fuel is possible, even likely.</p> <p>Weapons State/Pre-Planned: This changes the time when an aircraft automatically considers itself \"Winchester\" (out of suitable weapons) and returns to base. The aircraft can be used for anything from one BVR launch and run engagements to fighting to the last shell, depending on the situation. Fuel retreat can also be modified.</p> <ul> <li>Use Loadout Setting: The default, this goes with the inherent   loadout.</li> </ul> <p>For others, an example is in order: An F-14 Tomcat with a mixed arsenal of AIM-54s, AIM-7s, AIM-9 Sidewinders, and its gun takes off for a patrol mission.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Winchester: This disengages weapons concerned with that mission.   In the event of an air-to-air mission, it means everything that can   fire at aircraft. In the event of opportunity fire being set, it will   engage with air-to-air guns. In this situation, the Tomcat will fight   until it runs out of ammunition (or gets low on fuel). If it's serving   as a screen for ground units against enemy attackers or bodyguard for   a high-value unit, this setting is effective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shotgun: Less than the maximum number of weapons will be fired   before the unit RTB</p> </li> <li> <p>All BVR or Standoff means that the hypothetical Tomcat will fire   both its AIM-54s AND AIM-7s before returning to base, useful if   engaging say, a bomber formation.</p> </li> <li> <p>One Engagement with BVR or Stand-off is useful if it's facing a   superior opponent. It will engage once with (presumably AIM-54s) BVR   missiles, and then RTB. That way it can take advantage of range in a   hit-and-run engagement.</p> </li> <li> <p>One Engagement with \"WVR or Strike\" is useful if it's a ground   attack aircraft you don't want to hang around in the face of AA   weapons. It's also useful for a similar swoop-and-run attack done with   an aircraft that only has WVR weapons.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Make sure to turn targets of opportunity off if you don't want strange actions like an MPA or bomber flying over to engage a comparable enemy plane with its tail guns. (British Nimrods were armed with AIM-9s in the Falklands so this sometimes happens!)</p> <p>Weapons State/RTB: Like with the fuel state, this changes when the individual aircraft in a flight return to base. The \"last aircraft reaches _____ state\" options are considerably less risky than with fuel.</p> <p>A/G Strafing (Gun): This enables or disables strafing gun runs on air-to-ground missions. Whether it is to be enabled or disabled depends highly on the circumstances-a \"fight to the death for the sake of ground support\" situation with an inherently expendable airplane that has only a small number of bombs would support it being enabled, while an advanced aircraft operating against a target with a high level of AAA would support it being disabled.</p> <p>Jettison Ordnance: This enables or disables an aircraft jettisoning its A2G ordnance when under attack. An aircraft with no ordnance will be more maneuverable thanks to being lighter, but it also obviously cannot perform its ground attack mission. This was the real goal for North Vietnamese interceptors-shooting down American aircraft was just a bonus luxury.</p> <p>BVR Engagement Logic: This changes the doctrine aircraft will follow when engaging with long-range missiles.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Follow Missile Straight-in: The aircraft will continue to follow   the missile straight towards the foe. This can be used to simulate a   unit with rigid doctrine, poor training, or a desire to close to   visual range quickly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crank if Possible (DEFAULT): The aircraft will \"crank\" by tilting   to the edge of its guidance radar and slowing down. This symbolizes a   desire and training to stay at long range if possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Crank and Drag: The aircraft will not only crank but will, once   the missile goes active and its guidance is no longer necessary,   \"drag\" and move away from the target. This symbolizes a greater desire   and skill to stay at long range at any cost.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Anti-Surface Warfare:</p> <p>Use SAMs in ASuW Mode: If enabled, ships with SAMs that can fire them in anti-surface mode (which most radar-guided SAMs can achieve) will fire them at appropriate surface targets.</p> <p>Maintain Standoff: If enabled, units will attempt to stay inside the range of their own weapons but outside that of their known opponents. If disabled, they will charge the target and attempt to engage with every available weapon (which can range from a destroyer firing its missiles and closing to gun range knowing the danger, or it can be a missile boat with only a machine gun on deck trying to engage with that).</p> <p>Navigation: Select the appropriate method to navigate between waypoints.</p> <p>Use missile waypoints: When set to Yes, ASuW missile shooters will use the missile's waypoint/dogleg capability (if present and if the range allows it). If set to No, ASuW missile shots will always go \"straight in\".</p> <p>Submarine &amp; ASW Warfare:</p> <p>Avoid Contact: If enabled, the submarine will attempt to avoid contact with any known threat. \"Yes-Always\" makes it non-negotiable, while \"Yes-Self Defence\" means it will at least fire back to defend itself.</p> <p>Dive When Threat is Detected: If enabled, the submarine will automatically dive deeper when it detects a threat within the exact parameters of the setting. This can be a matter of radar detection, ESM detection, or simple proximity.</p> <p>Recharge Battery %, Transit/Station: This determines the threshold when a submarine will rise to recharge its battery and is not in an urgent engagement.</p> <p>Recharge Battery %, Offensive/Defensive: This determines the threshold when a submarine will rise to recharge its battery and is in an urgent engagement.</p> <p>Air-Independent Propulsion: This determines whether or not a submarine with air-independent propulsion capability will use it. Options are \"always\", \"never\", and \"when engaged offensive or defensive\" (aka, in urgent battles).</p> <p>Dipping Sonar: If enabled, helicopters will automatically deploy dipping sonar when hovering at a low enough altitude over water. If disabled, they will only do so if on a mission or manually ordered.</p> <p>Land Warfare:</p> <p>Navigation: This determines the type of pathfinding a land unit takes. If set to \"shortest route\" (the previous default) the unit will attempt to steer on the easiest path. If set to \"direct route\", it will simply move in a straight line towards its destination without any consideration for the terrain types.</p> <p>(WARNING: This may result in the unit getting \"caught\" on difficult terrain such as mountains. Use at your own risk)</p> <p>EMCON Tab</p> <p></p> <p>EMCON is the Emissions Condition of the platform/side/mission. It allows radar, active jammers, and active sonars to emit by default or not.</p> <p>This sets the ordered status of all emitters regarding Radar, Active Sonar, and OECM (Offensive Radar Jamming). Each emitter category has its own setting and has two states:</p> <ul> <li> <p>PASSIVE: Radars, Active Sonar, and OECM off.</p> </li> <li> <p>ACTIVE: Radars, Active Sonar, and OECM on. Be aware that active   sensors can be detected at greater distances than their sight range   (think the equivalent of seeing a flashlight beam) and should thus be   turned on only when necessary.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Setting EMCON: There are several ways of setting EMCON for a unit or group of units. At the beginning of the game, the EMCON settings have been set by the scenario designer. If the player does nothing, all Platforms will inherit the initial EMCON settings. The player can manually set EMCON settings in a variety of ways.</p> <p>EMCON Default Value: The default value for EMCON is \"Inherited\", where the platform inherits its EMCON condition from its parent platform and/or as set for that side by the scenario designer.</p> <p>Inherited EMCON: EMCON can be inherited from the scenario designer settings, Mission EMCON settings, Group EMCON settings, or Parent Unit EMCON settings. Platforms assigned to a mission will inherit the mission's EMCON settings and any embarked or assigned platforms will also inherit them. Aircraft automatically inherit their EMCON settings from either their parent platform or their mission is assigned to one.</p> <p>Manual EMCON: setting the EMCON settings of a platform or a group. Click on the unit or group and select the \"SENSORS\" button on the unit information window. Set the desired EMCON settings. You may get a message to confirm the manual override of the EMCON settings.</p> <p>Intermittent EMCON: Different \"alert\" levels can be set with sensors turning on and off at either random or set intervals, or in response to threats being detected. This can be useful for allowing active sensors to be used while not constantly blaring them, or for adjusting them based on context.</p> <p>ALERT LEVEL (side): The Alert allows a player to see and modify the side-wide alert level. Alert levels are Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow, and Red. The color designation has no meaning in reference to other colors. It only has meaning for how you configure the EMCON for individual groups and units on that side. The five colors allow the player to configure five alert levels for a side. The alert level can be changed manually by the player or changed based on events and Lua code.</p> <p></p> <p>ALERT LEVEL (unit or group): The picture above is of the EMCOM display for a unit or group that can be accessed through the menu, right clicking, or the buttons along the top of the map. While the sensors can be controlled basically the same as the Side EMCOM described above, it also includes an Active Emissions Intervals box. This is where Intermittent Emissions are configured.</p> <p>Different \"alert\" levels can be set with sensors turning on and off at either random or set intervals (Intermittent Emissions), or in response to threats being detected. Intermittent Emissions can be useful for allowing active sensors to be used while not constantly blaring them, or for adjusting them based on context. The Active Emissions Intervals box is where the emissions setting are input for each alert level plus a custom setting. The custom setting allows the player to have more granular control of intermittent emissions that aren't tied to the alert level. Keep in mind that for intermittent emissions to work, the sensor must be set to active, not passive.</p> <p>Active Emissions Interval box label definitions:</p> <p>Green/Blue/Yellow/Orange/Red/Custom tabs -- Separate intermittent emissions configuration screens for each alert level plus a custom level. Intermittent/Continuous Mode -- Switches between the Active Emissions Interval box and the alert level controlling emissions and passive/active drop-down boxes controlling emissions. If it says Intermittent mode, it is in intermittent mode. And the same for Continuous mode.</p> <p>Emission Duration -- How long, in seconds, the emissions will be turned on.</p> <p>Interval -- How long the emissions will be off, in seconds, before they cycle back on.</p> <p>Interval Random Variation -- A random variation added to the interval off cycle. Will be no longer than amount entered in seconds.</p> <p>Wake when detecting threat -- Will force the sensor to power on if a new unit is detected. If the player leaves Intermittent mode on, the sensor will stay on until the enemy unit disappears, and the sleep mode expires</p> <p>Time until sleep mode -- How many seconds will have to count off after a detected unit disappears for the sensor to go back into its intermittent cycle.</p> <p>Includes Stance and Includes ID - As you can see, the wake mode can be configured to activate with filters from detected unit posture and detection level.</p> <p>Warning: The Alert level setting is for the entire side. If you change the alert level in a unit's EMCON screen, it changes the entire sides alert level. If you want intermittent emissions for units and groups to not be impacted by alert level, use the custom tab in the Active Emissions Interval box and make sure the Use Custom Preset Only box is checked.</p> <p>WRA Tab</p> <p></p> <p>Weapon Release Authorization allows players to tailor different weapons for different targets. Unknown/unspecified is for targets not yet positively classified. Thus, an aircraft can be set to fire two AMRAAMs at a time at a fighter target and one at a time against a wallowing support aircraft.</p> <p>WRA refers to the target's \"Missile Defense Value\". This is included in the target's database viewer and is a guide to ideally how well they can defend themselves against a basic Harpoon-style ASM. A small missile boat or unarmed civilian ship has a missile defense value of 2 Harpoon-equivalents, while a high-end version of the Ticonderoga or Kirov cruisers has a whopping 96. Note that missile defense value only applies to positively identified targets.</p> <p>For warships, WRA is extremely useful to ensure that heavy missiles are not squandered on overkill targets (i.e. don't launch monstrous carrier-busting missiles against small sailboats).</p> <p>WRA also allows for maximum firing range to be changed to a distance less than the on-paper maximum. This is especially useful for scenario designers to ensure a higher probability of kill for their AI side, as the missile will have plenty of energy. It is also helpful to score kills against alerted enemy aircraft without wasting the missiles, as they will dive to avoid attacks, dropping below the horizon and causing direct-line-of-sight guided missiles to lose their lock.</p> <p>Another function of WRA is giving the unit \"personality\". On one extreme, a jumpy, ill-trained crew can be portrayed by setting the WRA to engage at the farthest range possible and fire the most weapons possible, regardless of the target. On the other, an overly cautious crew can be set to only engage at very short ranges and only launch one weapon at a time. A balanced unit will be in the middle.</p> <p>WRA can be combined with other doctrine and scenario measures to further flesh out the unit personality. These include side proficiency and engaging non-hostile targets (the jumpy unit should engage them the moment they appear; the cautious one will wait until they are 100% sure it's hostile.)</p> <p>The WRA can be set to a no-escape zone launch that causes a weapon system to only engage when the current target cannot 'escape' the weapon using a course reversal maneuver. If the target contact is unknown, the weapon will be launched at it using this option based on the unknown target's current speed. If the target type is known, the weapon will launch based on the target's maximum speed. This can result in shots waiting for a last possible moment in the instance of a very high-speed target.</p> <p>A final instance of unit personality is in emissions control. Many otherwise-skilled units have proven sloppy or clumsy with emissions secrecy in wars throughout history, and this can be simulated by having radars set to \"ON\" by default even when it is not opportune.</p> <p>Here are some typical examples of \"personality\" for aircraft are, using the same fourth-gen fighter with radar-guided missiles as a base:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Default. RTB weapons state depends on loadout, WRA is two radar   guided missiles (AMRAAM, etc.) at a time against a known fourth- or   fifth-generation fighter and one against anything else. This is a   sensible choice for most circumstances.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hit-and-run. RTB weapons state is Shotgun, one engagement with   BVR, WRA dumps all the BVR missiles at the target, with WVR ones   possibly disabled altogether or at least toned down. (This can be a   maddening adversary if he out-ranges and outruns you)</p> </li> <li> <p>Fight to the death. RTB weapons state is Winchester, all mission   specific weapons expended, allow targets of opportunity with guns. WRA   close to default. This can be taken to extremes by simply selecting   the \"No, aircraft do not RTB when weapon state is reached\" button.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Sometimes, different missions call for different personality sets. An interceptor operating in an environment of enemy air superiority would be suited for a hit-and-run attack, like North Vietnamese MiG-21s which near-invariably fired their AA-2s and then ran for home. An escort fighter would be more willing to fight to the end to make sure the enemy goes for them and not their charges. A nervous or inexperienced pilot will fire all their missiles at near-max range, while a veteran will wait until they can engage in optimal conditions.</p> <p>(Those optimal conditions vary by weapons and target and should be found by scenario editor experimentation.)</p> <p>EMCON is up to the player to interpret-it's possible to have a pilot/crew who cluelessly exposes the radar, or a timid one that never turns it on even when it would be justified. Both show inexperience and a lack of potential in their own ways.</p> <p>And of course, mission setups, especially for AI players, illustrate the overall personality of the side. A timid aircraft may launch and run, but a timid air force will simply stay on the ground.</p> <p>Withdraw/Redeploy Tab</p> <p></p> <p>This sets the doctrine for ships assigned to a port unit (see above, Docking Operations).</p> <p>Ships can be configured to automatically withdraw from the engagement and return to the nearest port if they are either damaged beyond a certain degree or low on fuel or ammunition. This is necessary for 'intelligent' AI missions and can be useful for a human player as well.</p> <p>The default is set to \"ignore\", meaning that ships will stay on their mission no matter what.</p> <p>The redeployment settings control when a ship is to re-emerge from port. The defaults have them only setting sail again at full fuel and ammunition loads less than 5% damage. The changes can simulate an emergency redeployment, or one where a full load merely isn't necessary.</p> <p>Targeting Priority</p> <p>The fourth tab on the Doctrine &amp; ROE menu is the targeting priority page. This allows you to customize what the priority targets are for a given side, mission, or unit. To create a new set of priorities, select the create button in the bottom left corner and then click on Add Item to create a new priority for the unit.</p> <p></p> <p>Automatic and manual attacks will ignore the priorities set here, so this tool is be used for units assigned to pre-planned missions and units that engage targets of opportunity. After pressing Add Item, a new dialog will appear:</p> <p></p> <p>This menu has several options to customize your priority.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Target Type: This picks the family or unit type of targets. It can   be left broad or clarified with the other options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Targeting Subtype: This is the specific subtype within a type of   targets that is focused upon with this prioritization. For example, if   you used Aircraft as your Type, the subtype could be bombers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Target class: This lets you pick the exact unit you wish to engage   with this priority. If the previous subtype was bomber, this would   allow you select the exact DBID bomber you wish to engage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limit subtypes and classes: This checkbox allows you to only see   units in the scenario as options to select.</p> </li> </ul> <p>After creating several different prioritizations, you can now order them in the main menu by pressing the Move Up and Move Down options. The target prioritization is affected by the WRA, so keep in mind that you may create a situation where multiple units must have enough 'weapons on the way' to a specific priority target before engaging down the list of targets.</p> <p>MISSION EDITOR</p> <p></p> <p>The mission editor is the backbone of COMMAND, and in addition to the shortcut bar, can be accessed by either pressing F11 or using the \"Missions + Ref Points\" drop down menu. The complexity of the mission editor is such that it deserves its own section. See 7.2 Mission Definitions and Details on page number 144, for in-depth information on the types of missions.</p>"}]}
