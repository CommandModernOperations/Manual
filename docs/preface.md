# Preface

Congratulations! You have purchased COMMAND: MODERN OPERATIONS, the
powerful global simulation of modern warfare at sea, in the air, in
space and over land. While the COMMAND development team have done their
best to make COMMAND'S user interface and gameplay intuitive, your
gameplay experience will be greatly enhanced by reading this manual.

## Historical Introduction

After the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender in 1945, the
naval world had changed forever. Of all the grand fleets of the past,
only the United States and its former colonial master, now inseparable,
stood intact. The Americans ruled over the sea as no power had before.
The Victorian Royal Navy talked about a "Two-power standard" of matching
the two next fleets. The Americans now enjoyed an "every power standard"
courtesy of their smashing victory, a standard they have not been keen
on letting slip. As fearsome as the Soviet Union was on land, its sea
power was marginal immediately following the war.

The age of the traditional fleet battle was over. Even had Stalin's big
fleet program came to fruition, the American head start was simply too
great. But there was another counter.

The missile, the submarine, and the jet bomber served as a potential
asymmetric counter to the carrier task force. As the Cold War
intensified, all three of these found their way into the burgeoning
Soviet Navy. Although the world fortunately never had to find out if the
"strike complex" could overpower the carrier group, it nonetheless
emerged as a distinct threat.

This technological arms race produced some interesting systems. The
Komar missile boat that sank the INS Eilat was both revolutionary and
quickly obsolete. Anachronisms like HMS Vanguard and the reactivated
Iowa's stood with oddballs like the carrier-launched U-2.

The aircraft carrier meant that the increasing performance of aircraft
could be harnessed in naval warfare, showing that all technologies are
interrelated. The battleship had been sunk, with jets and anti-ship
missiles finishing off what the propeller-driven carrier aircraft had
mortally wounded in World War II. And one of the first major procurement
battles of the Cold War, the so-called "Revolt of the Admirals" was over
which service would take the lead in deploying the biggest game-changer
of all: the nuclear bomb.

Meanwhile, the proxy conflict between the superpowers was throwing
gasoline on the fires ignited by the collapsing colonial empires. The
story of modern war would be written here. A large intervention here, a
small one there. The clash of two regional powers with the best gear
their patrons could provide, the dance of two minnows armed with
low-grade weapons. The defining conflict of missile-age sea war was
fought over two islands. The carrier battles of World War II gave way to
one near-miss that would have involved only three carriers at most.

And the ever-present fear of nuclear war, of the Russo-American World
War III, of the best of the best smashing against each other in an
apocalyptic struggle, dominated everyone's mind.

After a lull in the peace of the 1990s and unconventional war of the
2000s, the rise of China and oil-fueled resurgence of Russia brought the
issue of naval technology back to the forefront. Now, the missile age
has reached a new level, with weapons such as the Naval Strike Missile,
Yakhont, and upcoming ones like the LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile)
and DF-21 ballistic missile reaching new limits of stealth, speed, and
range.

That was at sea.

In the air, things were considerably more even. While the immediate
postwar Soviet navy was a small afterthought, its air force was not. The
jet age of aerial warfare started with a bang in Korea and never let up,
with the newly independent United States Air Force having its bloody
baptism of fire. The surface-to-air missile added a new element to the
old struggle in one direction, and the smart bomb likewise in another.

The period from Korea to Vietnam brought a focus on strategic capability
as the superpowers relied on bomber aircraft as their primary deterrent
before intercontinental ballistic missiles could get off the ground.
This led to some flashes in the pan like the B-58 and M-4 Bison. It also
led to enduring designs in use to the present day like the famous B-52
Stratofortress and Tu-95 Bear. The paradox of the chaotic 1945-1960
period for air power was that a "cutting-edge" aircraft could soon turn
into an obsolete one-trick pony, while a seemingly less-capable one
could stick around long after it was reduced to tossing standoff
missiles against a peer opponent. The Stratofortress had conventional
capability and endurance that has proved itself in every American war
since Vietnam, while the Bear has excelled as a long-range patroller.
Such paradoxes can be found across the services countries, with military
platforms frequently outlasting their intended replacements.

Lessons of the smaller regional wars, not just Vietnam and Korea, were
studied and debated extensively. The Falklands and especially
Arab-Israeli wars were scrutinized in massive detail. Exercises such as
Red Flag brought an ever-increasing amount of realism to training.

Thankfully, the brutal meatgrinder of aircraft and missiles over central
Europe did not come to pass. What did emerge was the Gulf War, a battle
with American aircrews facing an opponent with the exact technology that
they had trained against for over a decade. The resulting one-sided
battle cemented American dominance in the skies, at least for a time.

Yet looking at air or naval power in isolation misses the point. Even as
a branch, air or naval operations are simply one part of a bigger whole.
And as with all combined arms, the whole is greater than the sum of the
parts. Coordinated "jointness" is extremely difficult to achieve. Yet
when it is achieved, the result is overwhelming dominance.

This is the world of Command: Modern Operations. Reenact the battles of
the wars that did happen, pushing packages of Thunderchief's over North
Vietnam or sending F-117s over Baghdad. Explore the possibility of the
wars that didn't happen, be they skirmishes over disputed borders or
apocalyptic battles in the Fulda Gap. And speculate on the outcomes of
wars that *could* happen, in the Spratly's, Baltic States, or wherever
the imagination leads.

## What is Command?

COMMAND is a 64-bit, pause-able, real-time joint operations wargame that
that spans from shortly after World War II to the near future
(1940s-2020s). In it, you control integrated weapons systems. The most
common of these are ships, submarines, aircraft, and the bases they
stage from. Yet COMMAND also allows you to lead other less visible and
glamorous but no less important pieces of the puzzle. Satellites,
unconventional special or guerilla forces, and cyberattacks are all at
your disposal. The goal is to integrate all of those parts into one
whole.

You fight on a life-sized globe with meticulously detailed terrain both
above and below sea level. Everything from hills to thermoclines is
placed on the map and taken into account, and it's possible to stage
from one continent, strike another, and return. The instructions given
to your forces can be as broad or detailed as necessary. COMMAND offers
the ability to shift from hands-off broadly defined missions to hands-on
personal control and back at any time.

COMMAND includes a wide range of scenarios that span from brushfire
counterterrorism to short but sharp duels of fast attack craft to
theater-wide engagements where aircraft and ships across an entire ocean
must be coordinated and synchronized. Its internal scenario editor
allows for an even greater range. Scenarios on both extremes of the
conflict scales have been made, from nonviolent coast guard duties on
one end to full-bore nuclear exchanges on the other.

COMMAND is aimed to both entertain and educate. It shows the evolution
of warfare from the 1940s to the present and illustrates the complexity
that such combat has always entailed. It is a tool to show what has
changed throughout the decades and what has not, study the lessons of
history, speculate the future, and have fun.
