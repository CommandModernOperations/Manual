## CMO Architecture

Is CMO 32-bit or 64-bit? Any CMO build at 1307 or less is 32-bit. Any
build above that is 64-bit. There is limited performance boost in the
64-bit environment. But 64-bit has broken the memory limitations
inherent to a 32-bit app and can play much larger scenarios without
crashing.

What version of Direct X is CMO built on? CMO was originally built on
Direct X 9 but as of 2023 has been upgraded to Direct X 11. Any CMO
build at 1307 or less is DX9. Any build above that is DX11.

Can CMO run on XOS/Mac OS? It cannot run organically on any Mac OS. But
it run in the Windows boot mode or Parallels on a Mac.

Is CMO able to run on Linux? Some people have gotten CMO to run on
specific flavors of Linux, but it requires significant knowledge and
tweaking to succeed.

What's the optimum PC configuration for CMO? It depends on what you want
to do. CMO has run on very basic 8" Windows tablets with small to
medium-sized scenarios and limited time acceleration. Very large
scenarios with 1000s of units and 100s of missiles potentially in the
air will not run at maximum acceleration even on a modern Intel i9 CPU.

What kind of GPU should I get for CMO? CMO in its basic form is not very
graphics intensive. A top end GPU like an Nvidia RTX 4090 will only buy
you a slight increase in performance over an integrated GPU chip set.
But if using TacView in a large scenario, a good GPU can make the
difference between a smooth experience and an unplayable scenario
