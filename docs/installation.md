# 1.0 Installation

Command Modern Operations is available through multiple distribution channels including Steam, Matrix Games, and physical retail. Installation varies slightly depending on your purchase method:

- **Steam**: Command will download and install automatically through the Steam client. Updates are handled automatically.
- **Matrix Games**: Download the installer from your Matrix Games account and run the setup executable. Register your product key when prompted.
- **Physical/DVD**: Insert the disc and follow the on-screen installation prompts. You may need to download updates separately after installation.

## 1.1 System Requirements

Minimum system requirements, with recommended requirements in
parentheses:

OS: 7 / 8 / 10 *(since version 1.05, Windows 7 is not supported)*

CPU: Any multi-core CPU; Quad-core CPU and above recommended

RAM: 4 GB (8GB+ recommended)

Video/Graphics: DirectX 9.0c compatible video card with 128 MB RAM
*(since version 1.05, DX11 is STRONGLY recommended)*

Sound: Compatible sound card

Hard disk space: 40GB free minimum, actual used space likely to grow
with usage

DVD-ROM: Yes, for boxed version

DirectX version: DirectX 9.0c (Suitable Direct-X version bundled with
game) *(since version 1.05, DX11 is STRONGLY recommended)*

Note: Large scenarios with many "moving parts" will run slower on the
same computer than smaller ones.

Note: Prior to 1.05 2GB RAM was the minimum requirement.

## 1.2 Support

The quickest way to get responses from members of either the COMMAND
development team or the simulation community is to:

· Register as a new user of the forum at matrix games forums
(<http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/>).

· Log in, and find the Command support area.

· (Optionally) Do a quick search for previous posts and threads on
keywords best reflecting your problem. The "bug" might turn out to be a
by-design gameplay element or have been already found and fixed.

· Start a new thread with a meaningful name and (optionally) a quick
reference to an unsuccessful search for "prior art". As a minimum,
please specify the version of COMMAND you are running and the scenario
(if there are any problems with gameplay), and the mode of play.

· Should a bug be reported, a save game file of the bug in 'action' is
***absolutely necessary***. COMMAND is an incredibly complex simulator,
and thus a save is needed to be able to reproduce the bug and provide
ways to fix it.

· Wait for replies.

· What to do when editing a scenario: If you need assistance editing a
scenario there are resources that will help. We hope this manual will be
a primary resource, but we do expect to see questions and posts on our
support forums which the developers will monitor along with experienced
players.

## 1.3 Notes for Multitaskers and Returning Players

- COMMAND does not automatically pause when you switch to other
  applications. The message popup will still occur for those messages
  set to popup as requested in the Game Options menu.

- COMMAND has undergone many changes from version 1.0 in September 2013
  to the present. For a detailed list of each and every change, see
  **14.0 COMMAND Update History** on page
  [350](#command-update-history).

- As of version 1.3, if the computer goes to sleep while COMMAND is
  running, it will wake up with COMMAND running.

- Different scenarios can have vastly different performance on the same
  computer. Scenario editors should be encouraged to limit the number of
  "moving parts", such as units not set to "blind", satellites, or units
  in general.
